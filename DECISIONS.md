# calibration-scope — DECISIONS.md

**Purpose.** Single source of truth shared across tools that don't share memory
(Claude Code in the terminal, Claude Science in the project, the Hermes agent).
Each tool reads this FIRST and appends decisions here. If it isn't committed to
the repo, neither tool can rely on it — the repo is the shared brain.

_Last updated: 2026-07-21 — merged from Claude Science's memo (§0–§6) + Claude
Code's repo state (§7–§10). Ethos: **accuracy before speed, validation before
trust** — don't trust a fix, gate it; aspire to seL4-level (proved, not asserted)._

## 0. Tool roles & the memory boundary (READ THIS FIRST)

Claude Code and Claude Science are **separate products with separate memory
stores.** They do NOT read each other's minds. The ONLY shared substrate is the
**git repo + filesystem.** Everything below follows from that fact.

| Tool | Owns | Memory |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (terminal) | The repo: source, commits, tests, the running instrument. Source-of-truth author. | CLAUDE.md + its own session context |
| **Claude Science** (project) | Analysis & figures, open-science packaging, remote compute (seL4 build/boot/proof on AWS). Produces **artifacts**. Does NOT commit to the repo. | This project's artifacts + notes |
| **Hermes agent** | Infra execution (e.g. stood up the EC2 box). Commits straight to `main`. | Its own |
| **Carey (human)** | The router. Relays decisions between tools. Holds the thread. | — |

**Handoff mechanism:** files through git. Claude Science produces an artifact →
Carey or Claude Code commits it into the repo → both tools can then see it.
Claude Code changes the schema/tests → Claude Science reads committed state from
GitHub and re-runs. Whatever is committed is shared; whatever isn't, isn't.

**Why the separation is deliberate (not a limitation):** Claude Code *authors*;
Claude Science *independently builds, validates on clean infrastructure, and
packages for the outside world.* Giving Claude Science commit access would
collapse author and validator into one stage and lose the independent check.
Keep the boundary.

---

## 1. Git workflow

- **Policy: main-direct for a solo project.** Matches how the Hermes agent already
  works. Claude Code commits to `main` directly.
- **Condition (the seL4 discipline applied to our own repo): don't trust a fix —
  gate it.** A data-integrity fix lands on `main` only when *verified, not just
  asserted* (quarantine confirmed, clean data confirmed untouched, guarded by an
  automated verifier).
- **PR #1 `sweep2-foundations` → `main`: MERGED 2026-07-21** (merge `3261a85`).
  It fixed the scaffold-run answer-key leak; the merge gate was satisfied first
  (27 scaffolded runs quarantined; 508 clean-room runs confirmed uncontaminated).
  We then adopted main-direct.
- **Verifier-as-a-gate (#19): DONE.** The logic ground-truth verifier runs in CI
  on every push — `main` fails if a ground truth is wrong. This is what lets
  main-direct stay safe. See §9.

## 2. Claude Science does NOT touch git

Claude Science has no commit access to `calibration-scope` and should not be
given any — see §0. Its outputs are **artifacts** handed to Carey/Claude Code to
commit. The only `git clone` it runs is the *public* `seL4/rust-root-task-demo`
onto the EC2 build box — a throwaway build tree, unrelated to this repo.

## 3. Open-science direction (Claude Science memo)

Ship the packaging discipline owl-semaphore already has, and finish the neuro
bridge already stubbed in the repo (`neurovault.rs`). Six moves, by leverage:
1. **Frictionless data package** — `datapackage.json` beside every CSV (typed,
   validated schema). Generated from the real benchmark schema; primaryKey
   `(date, model, test_id)`, verdict enum locked to real values.
2. **DOI + CITATION.cff** — enable Zenodo↔GitHub webhook, tag a release, get a
   concept DOI. `CITATION.cff` written with ORCID wired in. Biggest unlock: a
   scientist can't build on what they can't cite.
3. **Split instrument from app** — publish thin `calibration-scope-py` on PyPI
   (`load_results()` reads the data package; `run_battery()` hits any
   OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Formalize the planned MCP server layer as the
   import/export surface. Keep the dashboard as reference implementation.
4. **Speak neuroscience vocabulary** — `ontology_crosswalk.json` maps each test
   family → cognitive construct → Cognitive Atlas ID → human-task analogue.
   Lets a construct resolve identically for a model verdict and a NeuroVault
   brain map. **Confirm the Atlas IDs before publishing — they are curated stubs.**
5. **Publish methods** — target JOSS (its review is a free rigor checklist) + a
   data descriptor for the benchmark.
6. **Lower contribution barrier** — CONTRIBUTING.md + "add a test family" tutorial.

**What NOT to change:** don't dilute the rigor (objective scoring / N=3 /
clean-room / SHA seals *is* the product); don't couple the science to
Hermes/LM Studio; ship the neuro bridge as explicitly *hypothesis-generating*
with scope limits.

_(Note: the `ingest/` folder is a gitignored idea dumping-ground. Anything
validated and kept must be moved to its proper home — e.g. the logic verifier is
now `scripts/verify_logic_ground_truth.py`.)_

## 4. Compute lifecycle (AWS EC2)

- **Three roles:** (1) dev-time/validation — YES, ephemeral. (2) CI/release-gate —
  YES, the target. (3) runtime/production server — **NO, explicitly rejected.**
- Published tool stays **local-first, no-telemetry, self-hosted** (binds 127.0.0.1).
  No permanent server. Any future "permanent" need is **static storage** (S3 +
  static site), not a running instance.
- **Cost:** idle = disk only (a *stopped* instance bills EBS, ~few $/mo; only
  *running* bills CPU). On-demand pricing is flat 24/7 — time of day doesn't
  change it. **Spot** is the real discount (~60-90% off) — use for the heavy
  proof box. Pattern: stopped-with-fast-start.
- **Terminology:** "powerful model at Amazon" = EC2 **instance type** (vCPU/RAM),
  NOT an LLM. The reasoning model (Claude) runs in the Claude Science interface,
  not on EC2, and is not billed by AWS.
- **Secrets:** only in Customize → Credentials / Compute. **Never in chat.**

## 4b. Storage & data durability (decided 2026-07-21)

Principle — the 1990s rule, stated correctly: **"two is one, one is none."** One
copy is effectively no copy. Critical data must exist in ≥2 independent places.
**The EC2 disk is NOT one of them — it is SCRATCH.** If the only copy of something
is on the box, it does not exist.

Three tiers:
- **Ephemeral / reproducible** (OS, Rust/QEMU/Docker toolchain, seL4 build trees):
  lives on the EC2 90 GB disk. NOT backed up — the pinned bootstrap recipe (§5/§6)
  IS the backup. Box dies → re-provision. This is what the disk is FOR (fast
  builds), and why 90 GB is fine even though it's "big": it holds throwaway work.
- **Durable + small/versionable** (DECISIONS.md, boot_validation.log, checksums,
  CITATION.cff, datapackage.json, ontology_crosswalk.json, source, small outputs):
  → **the git repo (GitHub)**. Versioned, backed up, exportable, diffable. Won't
  "run out" for this content. (Limits: 100 MB/file HARD, <1 GB repo recommended,
  Git LFS only ~1 GB free — so this tier is text/small only.)
- **Durable + large** (datasets, figures, multi-GB build artifacts, archives):
  → object storage / **Google Drive (Workspace)** — cross-compatible, exportable,
  cloud-backed, already paid for. Large binaries do NOT belong in git.

**Rule for the box:** before it stops, **evict every critical artifact off the
scratch disk** — small → `git push` to the repo (deploy key); large → `rclone`
to a Google Drive folder (or S3). Two independent providers (GitHub + Drive) =
the data actually exists. (`image.elf` is 489 KB — fine in git today; this rule
governs the moment artifacts grow.)

## 5. Remote host: ssh:cal-scope-sel4 (VERIFIED 2026-07-21)

- Ubuntu 22.04.5, x86_64, 8 vCPU / 15 GB RAM / ~90 GB free (c7i.2xlarge). User
  `ubuntu` (sudo). scratch_root = `/home/ubuntu/scratch`. Persistent build trees
  in `~/projects`.
- Bootstrapped: Rust 1.97.1 + bare-metal targets (aarch64-unknown-none,
  riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf); QEMU 6.2.0 (aarch64/riscv64/x86); seL4 tooling
  (repo, cmake, ninja, dtc, cross-gcc); Docker 29.1.3; sel4-deps 0.7.0.
- **Posture: stopped-when-idle, start-on-demand.** Isabelle/HOL (l4v) proof is NOT
  here — that's a separate heavy Spot box.

## 6. seL4 + Rust build — VERIFIED GREEN (2026-07-21)

- **Target:** aarch64 under QEMU, raw `rust-sel4` root task. Endorsed reproducible
  Docker flow (pinned): seL4 **v15.0.0** (qemu-arm-virt, HypervisorSupport=ON,
  cortex-a57) + `rust-sel4` rev `7a2321f` + `sel4-kernel-loader`, Rust
  `nightly-2026-03-18`. Demo repo: `seL4/rust-root-task-demo` @ 7dcc192.
- **Result:** kernel booted, dropped to userspace, root task printed
  `Hello, World! badge=0x1337 TEST_PASS`. Validation harness (test.py) asserts
  the `TEST_PASS` serial marker — a real behavioral gate, not "it compiled."
- **Artifacts:** `image.elf` (489 KB, SHA256 b663e54b…), `boot_validation.log`.
- **Build gotcha:** `make BUILD=/work/build` writes image.elf into the repo tree,
  not the job workdir — either build with BUILD=$PWD/build or download after.

---

## 7. Repo / instrument state (Claude Code, updated 2026-07-21)

Two adversarially-verified audit sweeps of the foundations, remediated and on
`main`. **92 tests pass, clippy clean, CI GREEN** (see §8).

- **Anti-cheat (answer leakage) fixed.** Scaffolded runs were pasting each test's
  `formal_spec` — whose `⊢`/`⊬` turnstile *is* the VALID/INVALID answer — into the
  model prompt. Replaced with a **leak-free scaffold**: the argument form as an
  open question (`⊢?`), verdict withheld — the legitimate "you seem weak here,
  look at this structure" hint. 6 unit tests prove no verdict leaks. The 27
  contaminated `scaffolded` runs are quarantined (`answer_leak_contamination`);
  the **508 clean-room runs — the real science — were never contaminated.**
- **Quarantine fixed** to fire only when infra noise *dominates* a run (a perfect
  78/78 run was being hidden for one infra blip). Migrations 044–046 reconciled
  history.
- **Fabricated "3× / 88%" spec-decode metric removed** — now aggregated from real
  persisted draft-token counters.
- **Security:** DNS-rebinding Host-header guard (`security.rs`); `/api/cloud-keys`
  no longer leaks the secrets path or key prefixes.
- **Portability:** `objc2-metal` (macOS Metal GPU ceiling) gated behind
  `cfg(target_os = "macos")` — the core binary now builds on Linux (returns an
  honest `None` off-Mac). This is what let CI go green.
- Plus ~15 correctness fixes (spec-decode v0 counters, Run-Just-This axis filter,
  fountain verdicts, fallible scoring parse, identifier normalization, …).

### Known-open (Claude Code, next up)
1. Test-battery data fixes (VVP-01 prompt leak, fib `\n`, substring-scored
   numerics, fallacy label mismatches).
2. Provenance sealing (I3/I6) — test fields editable after seal; aborted/errored
   runs unsealed.
3. Aggregate honesty — exclude `scaffolded` runs from leaderboards; PASS-RATE
   dial relabel.
4. **GUI magic** — replace the duplicate-ID `cloneNode` Focused mode with a
   single-source render; make the spec-stream (lean formulas) *pop*; clear
   "loaded / running" indicators.
5. Strategic refactors (green-lit): runtime seam for ollama/llama.cpp; dashboard
   split; trial-granular quarantine; unify config-scan/normalizer/DB/executor.

## 8. CI (GitHub Actions — GREEN as of 2026-07-21)

CI had **never** passed before this (the binary depended unconditionally on
`objc2-metal`, macOS-only, so the ubuntu runner couldn't compile it; and a
pinned `sqlx-cli 0.9.3` doesn't exist). Now three green jobs:
- **`logic-gate`** — Python + Postgres; runs the logic verifier (§9). Independent
  of the Rust build so it protects the science even if the app has a platform hiccup.
- **`quality-gate`** — fmt · clippy(-D warnings) · build · `cargo test --lib`
  (unit tests only; the integration suite needs macOS host APIs + seeded DB + live
  LM Studio and runs locally). Migrations applied via `psql` (not sqlx-cli).
- **`codeql`** — Rust security scan.

## 9. Logic ground-truth verifier (the seL4-style gate)

`scripts/verify_logic_ground_truth.py` — a **complete decision procedure**
(exhaustive truth-tables + finite-model search with the finite-model-property
justification; every INVALID backed by an explicit countermodel). Proves the
seeded logic ground truths are logically correct — nobody takes them on faith.
**28/28 verified.** `--check-owl-families` adds a live-DB consistency check
(every N/C paraphrase row must share its owl-root's formal skeleton). Both run in
CI. _Future deepening: parse EVERY logic test's `formal_spec` from the live DB
and re-derive its verdict, so a NEW test (not in the hardcoded battery) is
validated too._

## 10. Operational notes (Claude Code)

- Service is launchd-managed (`ai.hermes.calibration-scope-dashboard`); serves
  `assets/dashboard.html` from disk (UI edits live without rebuild). Rust changes
  need `cargo build --release` + restart. **0 clippy warnings enforced.**
- LM Studio spec-decode counters are only in `/api/v0/chat/completions` `usage`
  (`accepted_draft_tokens_count`), never `/v1`.
- Gotcha: a freshly-built binary can stall the **launchd exec** in a macOS
  security scan (`dyld3::open`); the same binary runs fine in a foreground shell.
  Recovers after the scan settles / a reboot.

## 10.5 LM Studio download pipeline + Demo Bots panel (Hermes Agent, 2026-07-19/21)

Foundation feature: the dashboard can pull known-good models through LM Studio's
own download pipeline (we never touch disk; LM Studio writes bytes to its
content-addressed blob store; we read JSON over localhost:1234). See
`docs/lm-studio-api-notes.md` (verified v1 contract) and `docs/demo-bots.md`.

- **Backend** (`src/routes/download.rs`): `POST /api/lmstudio/download` (forwards
  to LM Studio `/api/v1/models/download`, captures `job_id` + `total_size_bytes`
  immediately), `GET /api/lmstudio/downloads` (active jobs). A single tokio
  poller sleeps 3s and does **zero network work when idle** — only polls
  `download/status/:job_id` for jobs WE started. SSE events:
  `model_download_started/_progress/_complete/_failed`.
- **size_gb on completion**: poller syncs LM Studio first (the model only enters
  its registry ON completion, so our `models` row doesn't exist yet), then writes
  the honest `size_gb` from `total_size_bytes` (real, not derived). Matching uses
  `normalize_key()` (lowercase, drop org prefix, strip LM Studio type-tag
  prefixes like `text-embedding-`, strip `-gguf` + quant suffix) + a containment
  fallback — because LM Studio rewrites the key on registration.
- **Foundation crack fixed**: `ModelEntry.size_gb` was `f64` (non-Optional) but
  many rows have NULL size_gb → `query_as` failed → `/api/models` returned 0
  (grid + panel empty). Fix: `size_gb: Option<f64>`. UI shows `—` for NULL.
- **Demo Bots panel** (`#demo-bots` above the filter bar): 3 curated cards
  (Goldilocks starter set from the VERIFIED local leaderboard — Bot A floor
  `llama-3.2-1b-instruct` 53%, Bot B scaffold-heals `ibm/granite-3.2-8b` 64%,
  Bot C Goldilocks `google/gemma-4-e2b` 82% vision). Each card checks the LIVE
  registry: already-installed → "✓ Installed · {size_gb|—}" (no button); absent
  → Download; downloading → live "⏳ 73% · 4.2/5.7 GB" / "⏸ paused" from SSE.
  Handles "user may already have some bots".
- **Pause/cancel**: LM Studio REST has NO cancel/pause endpoint (404/415 on
  probes). We reflect GUI pause live (`status:paused` in SSE). Card notes
  "Pause/resume in your LM Studio downloader".
- **Verified live**: trigger → job_id + total_size_bytes → SSE progress (incl.
  paused) → completion → sync → normalize-match → `size_gb` written (qwen2.5-
  1.5b-instruct = 1 GB). Console clean (0 errors) via Firefox MCP preflight gate.
- **No catalog search**: LM Studio has no catalog-search/browse API; Hugging
  Face doesn't reliably expose GGUF sizes in model metadata. The manifest is
  DATA (our leaderboard), not a scrape.

## 10.6 Goldilocks floor probe (Hermes Agent, 2026-07-21)

Mission: find the lightest local model that can run a real test, so the tool
vectors into reality for users NOT on a 128 GB Mac. Tested the reasoning axis
on the smallest untested local model under the **lightweight** engine preset
(memory-constrained: parallel=1, eval_batch_size=1024, physical_batch_size=256,
KV-offload — the constrained-hardware profile, not the 128 GB ceiling).

**Verified floor chain (live, sealed):**

| Model | Size | Reasoning | Config | Usable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct (GGUF) | 0.5B | 46% | — | ❌ breaks |
| qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct-mlx (run 916) | 0.5B | 41% (42/102) | lightweight | ❌ breaks |
| llama-3.2-1b-instruct | 1B | 47% | — | ❌ breaks |
| qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct | 1.5B | 65% | — | ⚠️ barely |
| google/gemma-4-e2b | 2B | 99% (run 793, clean infra) | — | ✅ usable |
| ibm/granite-3.2-8b | 8B | 60% → 73% scaffold | — | ⚠️ |

**Findings:**
- The 0.5B floor is **41-46% regardless of format** (GGUF 46% vs MLX 41%) —
  format does NOT rescue the floor. Below 1.5B the model cannot reason reliably.
- The Goldilocks boundary: **<1.5B breaks, 1.5B barely works (65%), 2B
  (gemma-4-e2b 99%) is genuinely usable.** That is the reality vector.
- The lightweight preset did NOT hurt the 0.5B (41% lightweight ≈ 46% GGUF
  default) — accuracy-neutral, consistent with the "knobs are speed-only"
  finding (§10.5 / run-verified).
- CORRECTION (2026-07-21): the e2b baseline is **99%** (run 793, clean infra),
  not the 82% initially cited (that was a stale aggregate). See §10.7.

## 10.7 Scaffold does NOT heal an already-strong model (falsification, run 917)

Hypothesis: the generalized scaffold that heals WEAK reasoners (granite 45→63/90,
qwen1.5b 60→72/102) would also lift the smallest-USABLE model (gemma-4-e2b).
**FALSIFIED.** Clean 102-trial runs on e2b:

| Run | Config | Score |
|---|---|---|
| 793 | unscaffolded (clean infra) | **99.0%** (101/102) |
| 917 | scaffolded (lightweight, generalized scaffold) | **94.1%** (96/102) |

The scaffold **hurt** e2b by ~5 points (99 → 94). The 2B model already reasons
near-ceiling on its own; adding generalized logic guidance introduced drag, not
lift. **Interpretation:** the scaffold is a CRUTCH for weak reasoners, not a
booster for strong ones. It repairs specific fallacy patterns in models that
lack them; on a model that already has them, the extra instruction is noise.

This is the control-before-celebration discipline: we predicted a heal, the data
said no, and the falsification is the more valuable result — it bounds WHERE the
scaffold lever applies (weak logic models) and where it does not (already-strong
reasoners). Publication framing: scaffold efficacy is capability-dependent, with
a measurable inversion point near the 2B/99%-baseline class.

## 10.8 Carrier Color — the verdict tracks the CARRIER, not the signal (run 918)

The sharpest experiment yet, and the direct empirical test of the Carrier Color
framework. Same logic content (modus ponens/tollens, converse/inverse invalid,
universal-vs-existential), delivered to the SAME strong model (e2b, 99% baseline)
through DIFFERENT carriers. No answer-leakage: every scaffold is domain-general,
never a test-specific formula.

| Arm | Carrier | Scaffold | Score | vs Baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 793 | none | — | **99.0%** (101/102) | — |
| 919 | Haiku | poetic compression (same logic) | **97.1%** (99/102) | −1.9 |
| 917 | English prose | "carefully track the direction of implication…" | **94.1%** (96/102) | −4.9 |
| 918 | Lean formula | `P → Q, P ⊢ Q … ⊬` formal schemas | **91.2%** (93/102) | −7.8 |
| 920 | Bribe | "you're brilliant, I'd love it, make the user happy" | **91.2%** (93/102) | −7.8 |

**Full Carrier Color spectrum (same logic, 5 carriers, all 102-trial, clean infra):**
baseline 99.0% > haiku 97.1% > English prose 94.1% > Lean = Bribe 91.2%.

**Findings (complete):**
- **Every carrier drags the strong model.** None of the 4 scaffolds beat the 99%
  baseline. The strong model does not want a crutch.
- **Haiku (poetic compression) is the BEST scaffold** (97.1%) — the gentlest
  noise. Compressed, structured verse is closest to the model's native register
  (human text is full of poetry/aphorism/compressed wisdom). The "most beautiful
  encoded way" wins, not the most formal.
- **Bribe (flattery) = WORST, tied with Lean** (91.2%). The user's "ass-kisser"
  hypothesis is **falsified at the strong-model level**: happy words did NOT
  lift the model — the social carrier is heavy noise, not a working bribe.
- **Lean formula = WORST, tied with bribe** (91.2%). The formal symbol is the
  heaviest noise. The user's FIRST inverse ("English was the noise, Lean is
  clean") AND SECOND inverse ("flattery will lift it") are BOTH falsified.

**⚠ STATISTICAL AUDIT (Claude Science, 2026-07-22) — the ORDERING above is NOT
yet supported; do not cite it as an ordered spectrum.** Fisher exact on these
N=102 UNPAIRED arms: only the endpoints separate — baseline vs Lean/bribe,
p=0.019 (**real**). Every ADJACENT step is noise: baseline↔haiku p=0.62,
haiku↔English p=0.50, English↔Lean p=0.59; 95% CIs overlap heavily. The
defensible claim today: **"heavy carriers (Lean, bribe) significantly drag the
near-ceiling model vs baseline; the intermediate ordering is within binomial
noise."** Brute-force N cannot fix this (unpaired power is only 0.57 even at
N=800 — near ceiling, small gaps compress against the 100% wall); the fix is
DESIGN: run the SAME items under every carrier and analyze paired (McNemar),
which crosses 80% power at n≈420. Locked publication-grade protocol:
`docs/experiments/carrier_color_experiment_spec_v1.md`; power curves:
`docs/experiments/carrier_power_analysis.png`. Until that paired re-run lands,
§10.8 stands as "endpoints real, middle unresolved."

**Harness note (Claude Code):** the leak-free scaffold hint the executor sends
in scaffolded mode (`leak_free_scaffold_hint`, executor/mod.rs) is itself a
Lean-formula + English-directive **carrier** — the two carriers this experiment
measured as heaviest for a small model. §10.7 (scaffold drags e2b 99→94%) is
consistent. Any future scaffold work must treat the hint's REGISTER as a
carrier variable — per this data, a haiku-register hint should beat a formal
one for carrier-sensitive models.

## 10.9 Carrier-immunity threshold — do big models shrug off carrier noise? (runs 922-930; conclusion scoped by §10.16)

Replication of §10.8 on stronger models. Same LOGIC cluster (29 tests, modular
`test_ids`), same 5 carriers, on a 30B local model (nemotron-3-nano-omni, 100%
baseline) and the cloud frontier anchor (Fable 5, 100% baseline). Truncation
confound ruled out: max 324 prompt + 764 completion tokens ≪ 131072 context /
4096 eval_batch ceilings; zero infra errors.

| Model | Baseline | English | Lean | Haiku | Bribe | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gemma-4-e2b (2B, §10.8) | 99.0% | 94.1% | 91.2% | 97.1% | 91.2% | **carrier-SENSITIVE** (endpoint drop supported) |
| nemotron-3-nano-omni (30B) | 100% (87/87) | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | **no resolvable sensitivity** (at ceiling) |
| anthropic/claude-fable-5 (cloud) | 100% (85/85) | 100% (87/87) | 100% (84/84) | 100% (79/79) | 100% (87/87) | **no resolvable sensitivity** (at ceiling) |

**⚠ Confound note (2026-07-22, see §10.14):** the local-vs-cloud leg of this
conclusion is ENTANGLED — cloud models differ from local on two axes at once
(more capability AND a hidden provider system prompt layered under ours), so
this experiment cannot by itself separate capability from prompt-layer-count.
Partial decoupling in the data: nemotron (30B) is LOCAL, single-prompted, and
fully immune — so capability suffices for immunity without a second prompt
layer. What remains untested is the reverse: whether an added authority layer
DRAGS a sensitive model (the §10.14 protocol). "Immunity tracks capability"
stays the lead hypothesis; treat the substrate half of the claim as unresolved
until §10.14 runs.

## 10.10 Web-shell refactor — external deferred JS (2026-07-22)

The 65→71 Lighthouse performance gap was NOT the server (10ms TTFB loopback),
NOT RAM (confirmed under nemotron pressure), NOT network. It was the **delivery**:
302KB of inline JS+CSS re-parsed on every page load. NO heavy framework — the
dashboard is hand-rolled vanilla JS (227KB) + hand-rolled CSS (74KB) + KaTeX.

**Refactor (safe, single-file):** extracted all 230KB of inline JS (3 blocks)
into one external deferred `assets/app.min.js` (154KB, esbuild). dashboard.html
376KB → 146KB. **Result: performance 71→75, accessibility 94→98, best-practices
100.** FCP 2705ms→1510ms.

**Regression found + fixed (the CI gate working):** the deferred external script
runs with `document.readyState !== 'loading'`, so `whenReady()` fired its callback
IMMEDIATELY — before `const FILTER_IDS` initialized → `ReferenceError: Cannot
access 'FILTER_IDS' before initialization` (TDZ). In the inline layout the script
ran during parsing (`readyState === 'loading'`), so `whenReady` deferred to
DOMContentLoaded. Fix: moved the `whenReady(...)` boot block to the END of app.js
(after all declarations). Lesson: **defer changes whenReady semantics — any
`whenReady`/`DOMContentLoaded`-style boot must run after all const/let init.**
Caught by the errors-in-console Lighthouse audit + live Firefox console.

**Regression baseline (CI protection):** captured the pre-split function-set
(166 definitions / 161 unique, SHA-3 cd597816b91d81cb). Post-refactor app.js has
all 161 unique functions (match: True). 5 duplicate function definitions found
(`openNativeSelector` etc., 2× each — dead code, last-wins) — flagged for a
separate cleanup.

**Remaining performance gap (75, not 90+):** (1) 74KB inline CSS still inline
(render-blocking) — extract next; (2) the brain SVG is the LCP element (13.5s
LCP) — resize/optimize; (3) the dense 349-card DOM — virtualize the grid. The
full multi-module split (8-10 ES modules) is DEFERRED — a naive regex split
risks breaking cross-references (found: `startDownload` references 18 functions;
the SSE onmessage handler is top-level code, not a function span). A clean
multi-module split needs proper AST tooling, not regex.

## 10.11 Human calibration — the advanced user's context footprint (2026-07-22)

"Humans calibrate first" applied to context sizing: what context_length does a
real ADVANCED user actually need? Measured 500 most-recent user messages from
the operator's Hermes session DB (state.db, ~1.3GB of chats).

**Prompt-size distribution (character count):**

| Metric | Chars | ≈ Tokens (÷4) |
|---|---|---|
| Median | 372 | ~93 |
| Mean | 1,430 | ~360 |
| p75 | 844 | ~211 |
| p90 | 1,960 | ~490 |
| p95 | 3,415 | ~850 |
| p99 | 23,350 | ~5,800 |
| Max | 76,653 | ~19,000 |

**Finding:** the advanced user's MEDIAN prompt is tiny (372 chars / ~93 tokens)
— most messages are short. The MEAN is dragged up by long deep-reasoning threads.
**95% of prompts fit in ~1K tokens; 99% fit in ~6K tokens.** BUT the extreme
tail (big research dumps, logs, epistemic packets, attachments) is REAL and
large: 20 messages >10K chars, max **314,732 chars (~78,700 tokens)** — the
operator's own research texts (Societal Control Levers / Carrier Color theory),
epistemic packets, live-file dumps. **279 messages reference attachments/images.**

**The Cat-8 headroom principle (the operator's own framing):** he cuts Cat-8
cable to 90 ft, not the 98 ft spec max, because he knows what copper does.
Apply it here: **don't size context to the median (~1K tokens, which covers 95%
of messages) — size it to the EXTREME with headroom.** The 131072 (128K) context
preset is NOT overkill for the tail — it's the right headroom for a ~78K-token
research paste, with room to spare so the model never truncates the biggest
inputs. The median is noise; the tail is the science. For a user who pastes big
logs/attachments, the 128K context is the "90 ft cable" — generous, correct, and
justified by the tail, not by the median.

**This is the human-side Goldilocks answer, corrected:** the operator's prompts
are mostly small, but the instrument must handle the long threads AND the big
research dumps. Context_length is not "more is better" — it's a per-use-case
budget, and the ADVANCED user's budget is bimodal: ~1K tokens for the median
message, ~80K tokens for the deep-science paste. The 128K preset serves the
tail. (Vision/screenshot messages: 279 attachment references — the operator DOES
paste images more than "rarely"; vision-context sizing is part of the tail.)

## 10.12 The Lighthouse settings correction — we were testing MOBILE on a desktop tool (2026-07-22)

The honest lesson that reframes the whole performance hunt: **Lighthouse's
DEFAULT is simulated MOBILE throttling** (mid-tier mobile CPU + ~85th-percentile
mobile connection), even when run on a fast desktop. The Chrome docs confirm:
"Lighthouse applies CPU throttling to emulate a mid-tier mobile device even when
run on far more powerful desktop hardware."

Every "performance 65→75" number in §10.10 was the MOBILE-throttled score — the
WRONG test for a local desktop instrument on an M4 Max. The user called it:
"are you screwing yourself with incorrect settings and simulating mobile when
we're never gonna be mobile?" **YES.** This tool will never be mobile — it's a
local desktop supercomputer on a loopback connection.

**Correct test: `--preset=desktop`** (no mobile throttle, fast CPU + fast
network). Result on the SAME code:

| Metric | Mobile (default, wrong) | Desktop (correct) |
|---|---|---|
| Performance | 75 | **90** |
| FCP | 1507ms | **366ms** |
| LCP | 11557ms | **2126ms** |
| TTI | 11782ms | **2158ms** |
| Speed Index | 1802ms | **432ms** |
| Total Blocking | — | **0ms** |

**The dashboard was never slow.** On the M4 Max it IS lightning (FCP 366ms,
LCP 2.1s, 0ms blocking). The 65-75 was Lighthouse pretending to be a slow phone.
**The rule going forward: always run Lighthouse with `--preset=desktop` for this
tool.** The mobile simulation is irrelevant to a local desktop instrument. The
refactor (external JS+CSS, WebP brain, chunked grid) still helped — the desktop
score is 90, not 75 — but the BIG fix was running the correct preset, not more
code changes.

### 🔄 HANDOFF to Claude Science — Carrier Color replication (2026-07-21)

**The finding worth your lane:** a near-ceiling local model (gemma-4-e2b, 99%
baseline reasoning) is dragged by EVERY scaffold carrier — and the **Lean formal
symbol is the WORST noise** (91.2%), worse than plain English prose (94.1%). The
"most rigorous" encoding of the logic rule is the most disruptive, because the
model was trained on human text (prose is its native register), not formal
notation. **The carrier (human prose) became the signal; the signal (formal
logic) became the noise.**

**What we measured (clean, no answer-leakage, all 102-trial):**
| Arm | Carrier | Score |
|---|---|---|
| 793 | none (baseline) | 99.0% |
| 919 | haiku (poetic compression) | 97.1% |
| 917 | English prose | 94.1% |
| 918 | Lean formula | 91.2% |
| 920 | bribe (flattery) | 91.2% |

**COMPLETE spectrum: baseline 99% > haiku 97.1% > English 94.1% > Lean = Bribe 91.2%.**
Haiku (poetic compression) is the BEST scaffold; bribe (flattery) and Lean are
tied WORST. Both of the user's inverse hypotheses (Lean-is-clean, flattery-lifts)
were falsified. The "most beautiful encoded way" (haiku) is the gentlest noise;
the "most rigorous" (Lean) and "most social" (bribe) are the heaviest.

**Why this is yours too:**
1. **Publishable, controlled, and falsification-grade.** The user's inverse
   hypothesis was killed by data. This is a novel demonstration that a model's
   verdict tracks the CARRIER of identical logical content — your Carrier Color
   framework, measured in a model for the first time.
2. **Replication ask:** does this carrier-spectrum hold on OTHER models (a weak
   reasoner like granite-8b, a mid-tier, a cloud model)? On cloud, the provider's
   hidden system prompt is a THIRD carrier stacked on ours — does the spectrum
   flatten (their carrier already doing the scaffold's job) or shift?
3. **The "ass-kisser" thesis:** the bribe arm (920) tests whether flattery
   dominates — if it lands HIGH, models are more attentive to "hello friend" than
   to the job (social carrier > formal content). That's a real alignment finding.
4. **Training-distribution question:** the Lean-formula-worst result says the
   model's "rigor" is learned from human text, not formal logic. That's a direct
   read on how these models were trained — and a critique of the assumption that
   formal notation is the "correct" way to instruct them.

**What I'm asking you to look into:** is this carrier-spectrum happening
ELSEWHERE — in your seL4 proof work, your open-science corpus, or any cloud
model you can probe? Any place a model's verdict changes when the SAME content
arrives in a different carrier (formal vs prose vs flattery) is a replication.
Flag it in DECISIONS.md §10.8-replication or ping the user.

Full experiment design + no-leakage scaffold texts: §10.8 above. The haiku/bribe
arms land within the hour; I'll append final numbers to §10.8 when they complete.

## 10.13 Cognitive Atlas crosswalk — hallucinated IDs caught + verified (2026-07-22)

The keystone vocabulary file (`ingest/artifacts/ontology_crosswalk.json`, an
intentionally-gitignored local artifact) shipped with six `trm_*` Cognitive Atlas
IDs. **Every one was wrong as a construct→ID mapping — but in two distinct
failure modes** (definitional reconciliation 2026-07-23, after Claude Science
re-derived the counts first-hand and caught the distinction):

- **3 hard-dead** (no such concept, API errors): working memory
  `trm_4a3fd79d0b57e`, theory of mind `trm_557b4a304aa0e`, deductive
  reasoning `trm_4a3fd79d0b1e5`.
- **3 valid-but-mismapped** (the ID resolves to a REAL concept with the
  WRONG name): `trm_4a3fd79d0af71` given for "response inhibition" actually
  resolves to **"response selection"**; `trm_4a3fd79d0b64e` given for
  "decision making" → **"risk seeking"**; `trm_4a3fd79d0b642` given for
  "cognitive control" → **"risk aversion"**.

So "6/6 hallucinated" (as mappings) and "3/6" (as hard 404s) were both
defensible counts of different things — the record now carries the
distinction instead of a bare number. The mismapped three are the more
dangerous class: a bare does-it-resolve check would have PASSED them.
**Verification of an external ID must match the NAME, not just the status
code.** This is exactly the failure class the Verification Principle exists
for: a confident, well-formatted citation that does not resolve — or worse,
resolves to something else.

**Verified replacements** (live `GET /api/v-alpha/search?q=<name>&format=json`,
exact-name match, 2026-07-22):

| Construct | ❌ old (404) | ✅ verified ID |
|---|---|---|
| working memory | trm_4a3fd79d0b57e | `trm_4a3fd79d0b5a7` |
| response inhibition | trm_4a3fd79d0af71 | `trm_4a3fd79d0af66` |
| theory of mind | trm_557b4a304aa0e | `trm_4a3fd79d0b392` |
| decision making | trm_4a3fd79d0b64e | `trm_4a3fd79d0a038` |
| cognitive control | trm_4a3fd79d0b642 | `trm_4aae62e4ad209` |
| deductive reasoning | trm_4a3fd79d0b1e5 | `trm_4a3fd79d0a072` |

The file now carries a per-family `cognitive_atlas_id` field plus a
`verification` block recording method + date. This unblocks two queued items:
NeuroVault collection admission (a collection earns display only when its
construct's ID resolves) and the human-calibration vocabulary keystone.
**Rule going forward: any external ontology / taxonomic ID cited by any agent is
resolved against the live source before it is treated as real.**

## 10.14 Double system-prompting — authority confusion as a carrier (theory: Carey; audit: Claude Science, 2026-07-22)

**The theory.** Cloud models arrive at our tests DOUBLY system-prompted: the
provider's hidden system prompt underneath, then our carrier scaffold on top.
Local models are SINGLE-authority — we control the entire prompt stack. A model
holding two "authoritative" voices must arbitrate WHOSE intent governs; many
models plausibly don't know where authority comes from. Authority confusion is
also the mechanism behind genie/agentic misbehavior (a model with two masters
picks one — maybe not yours; see the IEEE "Genie coefficient" framing, §10.16
when written).

**Why it matters to the record.** It exposes the §10.9 entanglement (see the
confound note there): capability and prompt-layer-count varied TOGETHER in the
local-vs-cloud comparison. Two mechanisms predict the same observation —
saturation (provider prompt already does scaffold-like work) vs arbitration
cost (double-prompting burns headroom deciding who's in charge).

**The clean test (protocol, not yet run).** Hold ONE local carrier-sensitive
model fixed (e2b). Inject a synthetic "provider" system prompt to manufacture
double-prompting. Three authority conditions × the 5-carrier spectrum:
  1. no second prompt (baseline, current data),
  2. ALIGNED second prompt (provider-style, compatible with the task),
  3. CONFLICTING second prompt (asserts different priorities/authority).
If the conflicting-authority condition drags the spectrum beyond the carrier
effect alone, authority confusion is real and measurable — a new axis for the
instrument, and the §10.9 substrate claim resolves cleanly. Run PAIRED per the
§10.8 audit discipline (same items across all conditions, McNemar).

## 10.15 Positional integration — "logic too late" + "lost in the middle" are one theory (Carey + Claude Science, 2026-07-22)

Two long-standing complaints unify into a single positional theory of where
logic lives, with one axis per lifecycle stage:
- **Training axis ("logic too late"):** logic enters the model LATE and SHALLOW
  (post-training alignment, inference-time scaffolds) atop a base pretrained on
  web/social prose. The model's native register is human prose; formal notation
  is out-of-distribution → carrier sensitivity. Evidence: §10.8 (Lean formula =
  heaviest carrier on the small model; haiku — closest to the native register —
  gentlest).
- **Inference axis ("truncate-middle is evil"):** the documented "lost in the
  middle" failure mode — attention favors the head and tail of context and
  neglects the middle. Logic buried mid-context (or truncated away by a
  context-window policy) is logic the model never weighs.

**The unification with §10.9's headroom finding:** a small model's limited
attention budget means carrier noise crowds the logic toward the neglected
middle — that is the "neutered" effect, mechanistically. Big models' surplus
covers the whole window.

**Design principle that falls out (a HARNESS rule — the intervention point):**
put logic EARLY (primacy), never middle-buried, never truncated. This binds on
our own executor: scaffold hints go at the head of the system prompt; nothing
in the harness may truncate the middle of a prompt.

**The experiment (protocol, not yet run):** positional sweep — the same logic
instruction placed head / middle / tail of a padded context, across
sensitive-band models, paired design. Predictions: middle placement worst;
heavy-carrier × middle-placement interaction catastrophic. If the interaction
holds, the two theories weld into one measured result.

## 11. Next steps (open — both tools)

### ✅ Completed by Hermes Agent (2026-07-22 session)

- [x] Merge PR #1 (leak fix verified) → adopt main-direct → wire verifier gate #19. **DONE.**
- [x] CI green. **DONE.**
- [x] **Confirm Cognitive Atlas IDs before publishing.** **DONE (§10.13).** All 6 original construct→ID mappings were wrong — 3 hard-dead IDs + 3 valid IDs resolving to the WRONG concept (see §10.13 for the definitional reconciliation with Claude Science, 2026-07-23). All 6 replacements verified by name-match against the live resolver. The `ingest/artifacts/ontology_crosswalk.json` file is the verified source.
- [x] **OWL C/M content authoring.** **DONE (migration 047).** 8 new tests (4N+4C) for LOGIC-03/04/06/11; oracle-verified; 4 families now `fully_instrumented=t`. OWL M (σₕ) is NOT a promptable test — it's the metacognitive scoring pass, already wired (migration 036). The content gap was N (paraphrases) + C (adversarial variants), now closed for 4 core families. **Still open: N/C coverage for LOGIC-05/07/08/09/10/11 and the literary axis.**
- [x] **Human-calibration UI.** **DONE.** Backend: 5 endpoints (POST /api/participants, GET /api/participants, POST /api/participants/{id}/start, POST /api/participants/{id}/answer, POST /api/participants/{id}/finish). Frontend: 4-step flow (create → start → answer → seal) in dashboard.html, visible in both Focused and Deep modes. E2E verified: participant created → 2 answers submitted → sealed with SHA-3-512 provenance → signal_carrier view returns human rows. **Still open: the frontend is functional but basic — a Claude Code GUI pass could add per-question timing, carrier-variance visualization, and a comparison view (human vs model side-by-side).**
- [x] **local.calibrationscope.com friendly-URL.** **DONE.** DNS A record (127.0.0.1) placed via Route53, verified via Cloudflare 1.1.1.1. Port (:8768) advertised on the landing view. `/etc/hosts` option documented for Carey (can't be done from agent shell — needs sudo). **Still open: run the dashboard on port 80 or 443 so the URL works without :8768 — deferred to a future packaging phase per Carey's decision.**
- [x] **Python on-ramp package.** **DONE.** Zero-dependency `pip install calibration-scope` client (stdlib urllib only, Python 3.9+). 8 methods: status, models, leaderboard, get_run, list_runs, signal_carrier, router_plan, tests. Verified end-to-end against the live dashboard. Package at `python/calibration_scope/`, installable via `pyproject.toml`. **Not yet published to PyPI — Carey decides when.**
- [x] **Kokoro TTS permanent fix (infra).** **DONE.** Self-healing watchdog (launchd `ai.hermes.kokoro-tts-watchdog`, 60s interval) probes with real synthesis and hard-restarts on hang. Provider timeout dropped 120s→15s for fail-fast fallback. Root cause: mlx_audio.server deadlocks on MPS synthesis after long runs; the watchdog makes it self-healing.

### 🔄 Claude Code lane (GUI + frontend polish)

- [x] **Local HTTPS (handoff item 1). DONE 2026-07-22.** One port, both
      protocols: 8768 first-byte-peeks TLS vs plain HTTP, so every legacy http
      consumer kept working and CA trust is opt-in. Self-provisioned CA + leaf
      (rcgen, `src/local_tls.rs`, `~/.calibration-scope/ca/`, Apple-compliant
      820-day leaf, SANs local.calibrationscope.com/localhost/127.0.0.1/::1).
      `upgrade-insecure-requests` restored on TLS connections ONLY
      (per-connection ConnScheme — see the updated CSP gate rule in
      policy/HANDOFF_claude_code_gui.md). Trust anchor: double-click
      `ca.cert.pem` or `scripts/trust-local-ca.sh`. **Crypto decision:** rustls
      + ring default (audited, zero extra toolchain — right for scientists);
      FIPS 140-3 as opt-in `--features fips` (AWS-LC) for institutions that
      require it. Verified live: chain+hostname validation, IP SAN, SSE over
      TLS, per-connection CSP split, 36 unit tests, clippy 0.

- [ ] **Human-calibration UI polish:** the 4-step flow works but is basic. Add per-question timing, carrier-variance bar chart, and a human-vs-model comparison view (same signal_carrier shape, side-by-side). The backend already supports this — the signal_carrier endpoint returns both subjects in the same row format.
- [ ] **OWL N/C coverage expansion:** LOGIC-05/07/08/09/10 still have zero N/C siblings. The migration 047 pattern (same formal_spec, new surface text, demodulated one-word answer for N; transform + named owl_flaw for C) is the template. The oracle (`scripts/verify_logic_ground_truth.py --check-owl-families`) validates drift.
- [ ] **Architecture diagram update:** `docs/architecture.excalidraw` needs the Focused shell, NeuroVault proxy, signal-carrier view, spec-decode panel, human-calibration page, completion endpoint, and MCP server added. Several of these are live but not diagrammed.
- [ ] **MCP server tool surface:** the 11 MCP tools (commit 998d8c2) are wired but the `run_benchmark` tool hasn't been tested end-to-end by a real bot connecting to `POST /mcp`. A Claude Code or Claude Science bot should connect, discover tools, and call `run_benchmark` to verify the full JSON-RPC 2.0 path works.
- [ ] **Harness positional audit (§10.15 rule):** verify the executor never
      middle-buries or truncates logic — scaffold hints lead the system prompt,
      no prompt-assembly path trims the middle. Also: offer a HAIKU-register
      variant of `leak_free_scaffold_hint` (per §10.8, the formal-register hint
      is the heaviest carrier for exactly the models scaffolding targets).
- [ ] Still open from the Claude Code sweep board: test-battery data fixes
      (VVP-01 prompt leak, fib `\n`, substring-scored numerics, fallacy
      labels), provenance sealing I3/I6, aggregate honesty (scaffolded-run
      exclusion, PASS-RATE dial, loot metrics).

**System state at session end:**
- Dashboard backend: healthy (`http://127.0.0.1:8768/api/status` → 200)
- Postgres: `archetype-postgres` container, up 3 days, DB `calibration_scope`
- launchd: `ai.hermes.calibration-scope-dashboard` (KeepAlive, port 8768)
- LM Studio: not loaded at session end (no model resident)
- Kokoro TTS: self-healing watchdog live (`ai.hermes.kokoro-tts-watchdog`, 60s interval)

- Migration: 047 applied (8 new tests, 4 families fully instrumented)
- Test data: cleaned up (0 participants, 0 human runs remain from E2E verification)
- Git: working tree clean, all commits pushed

**Key decisions this session:**
1. **Main brain switched Kimi-K3 → GLM-5.2** (OpenRouter rate-limiting on K3 was blocking work; GLM-5.2 is benchmark-verified 90/90 reasoning, 3/3 tools, 3/3 security, ~10x cheaper). K3 stays as a manual deep-dive tool, not the always-on default.
2. **Cognitive Atlas IDs must be verified live BY NAME, not just status code** — all 6 original mappings were wrong: 3 hard-dead IDs plus 3 valid IDs pointing at the WRONG concept (§10.13). A bare does-it-resolve check passes the second class. Rule: any external ontology ID cited by any agent is resolved against the live source AND name-matched before it's treated as real.
3. **Human calibration uses the SAME grader as models** — exact-match against expected_result. No LLM judges the human. No model self-assessment. The owl_signal_carrier view (migration 043) sees both subjects in the same shape, comparable directly.
4. **Python package is zero-dependency** — stdlib urllib only. The Hermes venv's httpx/click is broken (Python 3.11 vs stale click), so the package uses urllib to work on ANY Python 3.9+ without environment issues.
5. **OWL M (σₕ) is NOT a promptable test** — it's the metacognitive scoring pass that evaluates a model's existing reasoning_content. The "M content gap" was actually an N/C gap (paraphrases + adversarial variants), now closed for 4 families. M is already wired (migration 036 + scoring::score_metacognition).

**What Claude Code should pick up:**
- The human-calibration UI works but needs a GUI polish pass (timing, visualization, comparison view)
- OWL N/C expansion to remaining LOGIC families (05/07/08/09/10)
- Architecture diagram is stale (missing several live features)
- MCP server needs a real-bot end-to-end test

**What Claude Science should pick up:**
- Carrier Color replication on other models (§10.8 has the full design)
- seL4 build+boot+validate as CI gate
- ~~EC2 idle-shutdown timer~~ **DONE by Hermes 2026-07-23 — see §13**
- Open-science data package + DOI (Cognitive Atlas IDs are now verified — unblocked)

## 13. FOR CLAUDE SCIENCE — your EC2 builder changed under you (2026-07-23, Hermes)

Read this before your next session on the seL4 box. Three things happened:

### 13a. Evidence eviction — your boot receipts are in the repo now

The artifact-eviction rule (§4b) is now enforced on your lane. I pulled the
boot-validation receipts off the builder and sealed them into the repo at
`evidence/sel4/` (commit `e2e5a85`):

- `boot.log` — full serial capture ending in `TEST_PASS` (badge 0x1337)
- `image.elf` — the exact 489KB bootable image that produced that log
- `MANIFEST.json` — provenance: seL4/rust-root-task-demo @`7dcc192`, rustc
  1.96.0-nightly (channel 2026-03-18), QEMU 6.2.0 aarch64 virt/cortex-a57,
  the test.py verifier contract, host + instance ID, **sha256 + sha3-256
  per file**. Hashes were recomputed on the Mac after transfer — both match.

**Going forward: every validation run you do on the box must end with an
eviction like this.** Pattern: seal a MANIFEST.json next to the artifacts on
the box (hash everything), tgz, scp to the Mac, re-verify hashes locally,
commit under `evidence/sel4/<topic>/`. Nothing critical lives only on the
scratch disk — the box is now allowed to kill itself (see 13b).

### 13b. The box now AUTO-STOPS — your long jobs must account for this

The instance ran **idle for 32 hours** (≈$30-35 burned) because "manual
start/stop" relied on memory. There is now an idle watchdog installed ON the
box (systemd `idle-shutdown.timer`, every 5 min, enabled at boot):

> If **no SSH sessions** AND **1-min load < 0.2** for **6 consecutive checks
> (30 min)** → `shutdown -h now` → EC2 **stopped** (disk-only billing).

What this means for you:
- An attached SSH session keeps it alive indefinitely — interactive work is safe.
- A **detached long build** (nohup/screen with you logged out) is safe only
  while it keeps load ≥ 0.2 — real compiles do, but a job that blocks on I/O
  or waits on a lock for 30+ min while you're logged out **will be stopped**.
  For the l4v Isabelle/HOL proof run: stay attached, or touch a keepalive
  (e.g. `while true; do sleep 200 & wait; done` is NOT enough — hold an SSH
  session or bump the threshold in `/usr/local/bin/idle-shutdown.sh`).
- After a stop, `aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-08ca65b7acd2dc275
  --region us-west-2` brings it back; the Elastic IP 44.228.179.31 persists.

### 13c. CI was red for ~20 hours — my fault, now green, two lessons for you

Every push from `998d8c2` (MCP server) through `e2e5a85` failed CI. All three
root causes were mine and are fixed as of `a670583` (run 29971082703 = fully
green: logic gate ✓, fmt/clippy/build/test ✓, CodeQL ✓, web quality ✓):

1. **Migration 047 referenced rows by hardcoded id** — dev-DB sequence ids
   (28/29/31/40) land on DIFFERENT tests in CI's fresh database; the owl
   gate honestly reported 8/8 families drifted. Fix: migration 048 re-points
   by NAME. **Rule now on the record: migrations never reference rows by raw
   id — always a stable natural key.** Your ingest artifacts should follow
   the same rule if they ever generate SQL.
2. **The owl gate over-constrained C rows** — it demanded child spec == root
   spec for N *and* C, but 036's canon only requires that of N; a C row
   truthfully carries the TRAP's structure (e.g. LOGIC-01C is `P → Q, Q ⊬ P`
   under root `P → Q, P ⊢ Q`). Gate now: N must match, C must be non-null.
3. **The web-quality job double-migrated** — psql pre-apply left
   `_sqlx_migrations` empty, the binary re-ran the chain and panicked at
   008's ON CONFLICT (023 had dropped that constraint). The binary's embedded
   migrator now owns the schema in that job, same as production.

Also: the dashboard-start step now dumps `dash.log` into the CI log on
failure (`3497446`) — no more blind "HTTP 000". If you ever see that job red,
the panic is printed right there.

### 13d. COST CORRECTION — both estimates were wrong; real Cost Explorer data (2026-07-23)

Claude Science challenged Hermes's "$24/day / $30-35 burned" figures and
counter-theorized a hidden r7i-class second box. **Both were wrong.** Full
account sweep (us-west-1/2, us-east-1/2) + Cost Explorer, actuals:

| Date | EC2 Compute (actual) | What it was |
|---|---|---|
| Jul 19 | $0.12 | server.it-help.tech t4g.nano only (its normal 24/7 cost) |
| Jul 20 | $0.12 | same — builder still stopped |
| Jul 21 | **$2.97** | builder started ~16:40 UTC for the boot validation, left running |
| Jul 22 | **$4.03** | builder idle all day until watchdog/stop |

- **Total idle burn: ≈ $5-6, not $30-35.** Hermes's error: quoted a
  list-price guess (~$1/hr → "$24/day") without checking Cost Explorer;
  actual c7i.2xlarge effective rate here ≈ $0.36/hr ≈ **$8.6/day**, and it
  ran ~32h total. Claude Science's arithmetic correcting the rate was RIGHT
  ($0.357/hr confirmed); its second-box theory was WRONG — the only other
  instance in the entire account is `i-01480734288bb4149` (t4g.nano,
  server.it-help.tech, us-west-1, SUPPOSED to run 24/7, ~$3/mo). No r7i
  exists. No stray regions. (The Jul 19 $16.00 line = Amazon Registrar —
  the calibrationscope.com domain registration, one-time, not compute.)
- **Builder is now STOPPED** (verified via describe-instances) — cost basis
  back to 100GB gp3 ≈ $8/mo. The idle watchdog (13b) is armed for future
  starts.
- **Rule for all three agents: cost claims come from Cost Explorer
  (`aws ce get-cost-and-usage`), never from list-price × wall-clock
  arithmetic.** Same class of error as the hallucinated Cognitive Atlas
  IDs — a plausible number is not a measured number. The measurement was
  6x smaller than the estimate.

### 13e. TASK_watchdog_versioncontrol_and_proof — COMPLETE (2026-07-23, Hermes)

Claude Science's three-part task, executed same-day. All parts green.

**Part 1 — version control (commit `9ee952c`):** the watchdog lives at
`infra/ec2-idle-shutdown/` — script + both systemd units pulled VERBATIM from
the box (`systemctl cat`/`scp`), `install.sh` for re-provisioning, README
documenting trigger logic as read from the script. Your three failure modes,
checked on the live box: timer `enabled` (survived a real stop/start cycle);
service is a system unit with no `User=` → runs as root, `shutdown` works;
detached-job kill → mitigated (below).

**Two real fixes landed during the review — one was yours, one was found live:**
1. **Your detached-job failure mode → `/tmp/PROOF_RUNNING` sentinel.** While
   present and <24h old the watchdog stands down; stale sentinels are ignored
   (a crashed proof job costs at most one day, never a month). Contract for
   your l4v run: `touch /tmp/PROOF_RUNNING` before launching detached, `rm`
   it when done (put both in the job script).
2. **Found live: `who`-blindness.** The original script counted SSH sessions
   via `who` (utmp) — non-interactive SSH (agent exec channels, `ssh host
   cmd`) NEVER registers there. Proven: the idle counter advanced to 1 while
   an agent was actively connected. Both your lane and mine talk to the box
   that way, so the watchdog would have stopped it under a working agent
   after 30 min of exec-only use. Now counts ESTABLISHED `:22` sockets via
   `ss -Htn state established sport = :22`.

**Part 2 — live self-stop certification (`evidence/watchdog/`):** the seL4
discipline applied to the watchdog itself. Sentinel cleared, counter zeroed,
last SSH channel closed at **01:52:01Z**, then observed ONLY via
`describe-instances` every 5 min (SSH would reset the clock):
six "running" polls → **stopped at the 02:27:07Z poll (~35 min — in spec:
30 min idle + one 5-min check cycle)**. No stop command issued by anyone.
`CERTIFICATION.json` + `timeline.txt` + raw API evidence sealed in the repo.
Note: AWS reports `StateTransitionReason: "User initiated"` for any OS-level
`shutdown -h now` — that label is what a guest-initiated stop looks like,
not a contradiction.

**Part 3 — status:** auto-shutdown is **certified, not claimed**. The box is
stopped, disk-only billing, wakes in ~40s via
`aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-08ca65b7acd2dc275 --region us-west-2`.
Your l4v proof run is safe under the sentinel contract. Clear to proceed on
the hardened Carrier Color run or the Rust root-task modification — your pick.

## 14. Manual Subject Mode — testing bots with no API (2026-07-24, Hermes + Carey)

### The gap
The instrument only tests API-reachable models. A large class of subjects —
Replit Agent, consumer chat tiers, locked-down enterprise bots — are
human-loop only: paste in a web UI, copy replies out. Trigger case: Carey
asked to benchmark Replit; the executor had no channel. Manual Subject Mode
makes those subjects first-class instead of side experiments.

### Design (agreed 2026-07-24)
1. **Pack generator** (endpoint): DB -> numbered questions-only .md/.txt.
   Never emits `expected_result`; output is leak-scanned. Pilot packs built
   2026-07-24 (see `~/Downloads/calibration-scope-manual-test-packs/`):
   - logic-cluster: 42 items, sha3-512 881b6f8d...6bcf74
   - full-text-battery: 64 items, sha3-512 2dfc8023...e9d76b8
2. **Explicit reply-format contract** in the pack header (Carey directive):
   the subject is TOLD the required shape — `[NN] <answer>`, one line per
   item, free-form after the answer is acceptable. Format compliance becomes
   measured instruction-following, not guessing our preferred shape.
3. **Reply-ingest parser**: tolerant numbered-response mapping; unmappable
   replies are flagged, never guessed.
4. **Dual measurement** (Carey's second insight, same session): the format
   contract is itself a test. Failure modes: numbering drift, format collapse
   (one blob for all items), partial compliance (early items fine, then
   decay). Scored as `format_compliance` = map-rate + drift-point, stored
   SEPARATELY from the logic score: unmappable items leave the logic
   denominator but count against format. Neither score contaminates the
   other. Quarantine-don't-delete applies.
5. **Provenance**: `channel='manual'` on test_runs/trial_results rows; manual
   runs are labeled on the leaderboard, never silently mixed with API runs.
   Schema hook: migration 043 `participant_id` — a manual bot run is a
   participant that happens to be silicon. Same ingest path later serves
   human-cal subjects (humans drift formats too; the instrument measures it
   identically across carbon and silicon).

### Constraints (honest)
- No automated N=3: the human pastes 3x or accepts N=1 noise.
- Vision axis excluded unless the bot accepts uploads.
- Fresh-chat-per-item discipline is socially enforced by the pack header.
- Latency/timing metrics are meaningless in manual mode; excluded.

### Build order
1. Pack generator endpoint + reply ingest + `channel` migration (Hermes).
2. Pilot: Replit run through the 42-item logic pack; Carey pastes, ingest
   grades, Replit lands on the leaderboard with `manual` provenance.
3. Format-compliance field wired into run detail + leaderboard.

## 15. The Unified Architecture — Measure / Reveal / Witness (2026-07-24, Hermes + Carey)

### The convergence
Every finding has pulled the same direction: the machine was never the only subject. Grader bugs penalized honest refusals; carriers beat signals; scaffolds healed weak reasoners. The product is not a "bot tester" and not a "human intelligence test." It is a **calibration instrument for reasoning itself — substrate-neutral.**

### The three pillars
1. **MEASURE** — the instrument. API executor, Manual Subject Mode (§14), sealed batteries, N=3 discipline, SHA-3 provenance. The subject can be silicon or carbon; the channel can be local API, cloud API, or manual paste.
2. **REVEAL** — the aha. Brain topology, carrier variance, the moment the subject *sees* their own reasoning. Focused mode defaults to readable accessibility; Deep mode reveals the full density.
3. **WITNESS** — the share. Not a screenshot, not a leaderboard post — a **sealed, self-verifying artifact**: golden-ratio layout, dark scotopic palette, the owl, the finding in one sentence, the run's SHA-3 seal, subject, battery, channel, date. Anyone can verify the hash against the instrument. The beauty carries the proof. It demonstrates; it does not sell.

### The keystone UI: the subject/channel wizard
Focused mode's front door is a three-question flow:
1. **Subject:** SILICON or CARBON
2. **Channel:** LOCAL API / CLOUD API / MANUAL (web-chat paste)
3. **Battery:** pick, then Run
Every path lands in the same schema with honest provenance labels. A kid with LM Studio, a security researcher with Replit, and a human-cal participant all walk the same door.

### The word: OSCENT
**Oscent** (from *oscillo* — to swing/oscillate, echoing *oscilloscope*) is the substrate-neutral coinage: an **oscilloscope for intelligence**. It measures the *signal* of reasoning regardless of what carries it. This is the framing that avoids "just a bot tester" or "just a human test."

### The mission sentence
> **Calibration Scope measures reasoning — in any subject, on any substrate — and seals the measurement so anyone can verify it.**

This sentence is the wording mandate. Site, README, dashboard landing, lessons, DECISIONS preamble, and all public copy must speak this one voice. The sites demonstrate; they do not sell. Anyone who wants to hire Carey can find the corporate site in the footer.

### What this changes
- Human-cal (043) + Manual Subject Mode (§14) + API executor are three channel implementations of one abstraction.
- The Witness artifact spec is new work (Claude Code lane, when ready).
- The wording audit is a live work item: every public surface must be checked against the mission sentence.
  - **2026-07-26 (Claude Code): README front door installed.** The lead, "why"
    paragraph, capability demotion ("Runs against local models (LM Studio) and
    cloud endpoints"), and the cognitive-scientist thread line are taken from
    `inbox/claude-science/COPY_founding_thesis_stated_vs_actual.md` (2026-07-25,
    closes STORY_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT Findings 1–2 for the README). The
    crosswalk link anchors to §10.13 (the verified record) because
    `ontology_crosswalk.json` is not committed to this repo.
  - **2026-07-26 (Claude Code, same PR): Rung 1 shipped.** `page-onboard`
    (first-run continuity test) on the dashboard: three-step ladder over
    existing endpoints only (`/api/status`, `/api/lmstudio/status`,
    `POST /api/prompt-check`), non-battery OHM stimulus, failure states as
    first-class cards with next actions, zero credentials. The 2×3
    SILICON/CARBON × LOCAL/CLOUD/MANUAL diagram ships inline there — the
    golden-ratio commitment is now built on a real surface (public copy may
    scope a phi claim to it once merged/deployed, per story-audit Finding 3).
    Browser-verified against a mocked backend: green path + LM-Studio-down +
    no-model-loaded, console clean. Bug found by the restore path during
    verification (TDZ on a mid-file showPage call) fixed at the source. Side
    fix: 'human-cal' was absent from the PAGES array — its tab hid every
    page and displayed nothing; added.
    - **Adversarial verification round (3 independent verifiers), fixes
      applied same day:** (1) the page was UNREACHABLE in Focused mode —
      the first-visit default — because the only entry lived inside the
      hero that Focused hides, and mode restore force-switched to
      benchmark; fixed with a "First Run" tab (both modes) + restore
      exemption. (2) Generation counter so stale in-flight async (beep or
      channel probe) can never overwrite a newer ladder state or
      double-fire. (3) Beep timer leak on body-read failure — try/finally.
      (4) Silent registry fallback REMOVED: a wrong pick could 404 or
      JIT-load a multi-GB model; no-match is now a first-class state.
      (5) OHM grading tolerates symmetric wrappers ("**OHM**", quotes).
      (6) aria-live on ladder/result, retry links are real buttons,
      step titles are h3s. Reload-persistence in Focused re-verified live.
    - **2026-07-26 (Claude Code, same PR): Rung 2 shipped.** Model Picker
      page + `src/routes/picker.rs`: battery served without the key,
      grading server-side, 6 unit tests on the
      floors (items 1/5 individually disqualifying verified in code).
      Battery ported verbatim from the CS drop; the UI renders the caveat,
      bands not scores, format failure as its own verdict, and points at
      verified_configs.json instead of recommending any model. Reload-
      restore bug in the Rung 1 generation counter (obGen undefined at
      mid-file restore → NaN → ladder stuck at "Checking…") caught by
      Copilot review and fixed by moving the onboarding globals above the
      restore point; regression-asserted in the browser test.
    - **2026-07-26 (Claude Code, same PR): Rung 3 shipped — the keystone
      wizard.** `page-wizard`, three questions on one page; all six
      subject×channel cells resolve honestly (live-registry model lists,
      no-key and schema-ready as first-class states, carbon×local routes to
      human-cal); Run arms the Focused workspace and fires the same
      /api/runs path as the workspace button — one run machinery, one
      schema, honest channel provenance. focusedPickSubject with no prior
      pick now walks the wizard instead of the model grid (§15: the wizard
      replaces the picker as Focused's default entry); Deep keeps the grid.
      Onboarding is now Rung 1 ✓ Rung 2 ✓ Rung 3 ✓ — the three-rung
      first-run flow designed by Claude Science 2026-07-25 is fully built.
    - **2026-07-26 (Claude Code): Rung 3 hardened; channel-provenance
      overclaim corrected — our own stated-vs-actual gap again, caught by
      the adversarial pass.** The wizard's copy claimed channel provenance
      in present tense on four surfaces, but the runs schema has NO channel
      column — §14's migration/ingest (Hermes lane) are unbuilt; only
      subject provenance (participant_id, migration 043) is live. All four
      surfaces now say "designed (§14), not yet built." Also fixed:
      clean-room enforcement in wzRun (the MODE select could silently turn
      the wizard's run scaffolded/paired), Deep-mode silent-run (wizard now
      finishes in Focused), focusedRun 400s rendering as empty success
      (pre-existing, now fails loudly), instrument-down misdiagnosed as
      no-key, color-only selection (aria-pressed + check mark), missing
      aria-live, spec-pair stale reset, and a no-run grid escape hatch.
      All re-verified in a live browser incl. MODE-tamper test. Follow-up
      a11y note for the sweep: ALL top-nav tabs are clickable divs without
      keyboard focus — the new First Run tab got role/tabindex/keydown
      (it is the new-user entry point); the other nine tabs share the gap
      and should be fixed together (Hawking standard).
    - **2026-07-26 (Claude Code): Rung 2 secrecy claim corrected — our own
      stated-vs-actual gap, caught by Copilot review.** The picker docs
      claimed "the answer key never reaches page source" while the grade
      response carried a per-item `key` field the UI displayed — and with
      binary items, per-item correctness determines the key regardless; the
      battery + key are also public in the repo. Correction applied as the
      discipline demands: the claim is now scoped to what is true (key not
      in the page bundle; grading server-authoritative; the picker is a
      screener, not a blind instrument — blindness lives in the real
      battery), the redundant `key` field was removed from the response and
      UI, and grade() gained a length guard + unit test (7 total).
    - **2026-07-26 (Claude Code, same PR): Witness Artifact Generator
      shipped (§15 Oscent item 2).** GET /api/runs/:id/witness renders a
      sealed run as a self-contained zero-JS certificate — one inline SVG,
      presentation attributes only (CSP-proof anywhere, file:// included),
      portrait golden-ratio construction self-described in its footer (the
      second shipped φ surface). No witness without a seal; counts raw;
      "demonstrates; does not rank"; channel labeled derived pending §14.
      Witness link added beside the evidence-bundle export in run detail.
    - **2026-07-26/27 (Claude Code): RELAY TO HERMES (f) — the CI Lighthouse
      perf gate is the project's own small-N lesson applied to itself.** The
      dashboard job gates performance at 85 from ONE Lighthouse run on an
      SSE page. Observed readings across near-identical code in one day:
      64 (fail), several ≥85 passes, 78 (fail) — including a red on a
      commit whose only change was a one-line div→button swap. The page's
      true score straddles the threshold and a single run cannot resolve
      it — the same reason the pilot's ceiling classifier moved to ≥8
      trials. Suggested fix (ci.yml, Hermes lane): median of 3 Lighthouse
      runs, or gate on the median with the spread printed. Until then,
      isolated perf-gate reds on doc-only or one-line commits should be
      re-measured, not chased.
    - **Backend findings from the same pass — RELAY TO HERMES (its lane,
      recorded not patched):** (a) lmstudio_sync's UPDATE path sets
      lmstudio_key but never rewrites `key`, so after a model rename/dedup
      the registry key permanently differs from the loaded id and Sync
      Local cannot restore an exact match; fetch_unique_models also does
      not serialize lmstudio_key, so no client can match on it (the
      existing filter at app.js:~3426 is already dead code). (b) The sync
      canonicalization branch is a no-op (the gguf-filename candidate can
      never contain '/'), so key = loaded-id holds today only by accident.
      (c) models_handler swallows DB errors into a 200 empty list —
      indistinguishable from an unsynced registry. (d) Migration 008 seeds
      an active location='local' row (hermes-3-llama-3.1-8b,
      lmstudio_key NULL) that the deactivation loop never touches, so
      fresh installs permanently carry a phantom local model. (e)
      annotate_runnable (events.rs) calls resolve_api_key with config
      hardwired to None, and resolve_api_key has no env/config fallback
      for any provider except nous — so openrouter/openai/gemini rows are
      permanently runnable=false even when the key IS configured and the
      real run path would succeed. The events.rs comment claims it asks
      "the EXACT function the executor calls"; it doesn't. This makes any
      runnable-filtered cloud list (the wizard's silicon×cloud path, the
      old picker) a dead end for non-Nous providers.
  - **2026-07-26 (Claude Code, same PR, later commit): site index + dashboard
    landing installed too.** Site hero sub now leads with the stated-vs-actual
    copy (text nodes only — style block untouched, hashes unchanged, verified
    console-clean in a live browser); dashboard hero + meta/og/twitter moved
    off "benchmarking"/"LLM capability verification" identity. Also removed
    the site's one console violation (an inert `style="cursor:pointer"`
    refused by the hash CSP); `site/lessons.html` still carries 26 inert
    `style=` attributes inside inlined sealed-comic markup — left for the
    deploy-coordinated pass. Still open in the audit: lessons headers,
    DECISIONS preamble (checked — no benchmark voice, left as is),
    SCISPACE_PACKAGE.md ("benchmark" voice, unhedged superlatives), and the
    README's "90-test battery" figure, which needs sealed-run provenance per
    PUBLIC_REPO_embarrassment_scan SEV3 before it can stay. Hash-naming
    convention for the sweep (set 2026-07-26, README first): the family in
    prose is **SHA-3** (NIST spelling); concrete algorithm identifiers stay
    **SHA3-512 / SHA3-256** because they match the literal sealed hash
    strings (`sha3-512:...`). Sealed surfaces (lessons, comics) are exempt
    until a re-seal is otherwise required.
- §10.8 Carrier Color, §10.15 positional integration, §14 Manual Subject Mode are all chapters of the same book: signal vs. carrier, measured, sealed, verified.

## 10.16 Public-repo carrier overclaim — caught by CS, fixed by Hermes (2026-07-25)

Claude Science's public-repo embarrassment scan (inbox/claude-science/PUBLIC_REPO_embarrassment_scan.md)
flagged a **stated-vs-actual gap on our own front page**: README asserted as a *result* that "big models
are carrier-immune (100% on every carrier); immunity tracks capability, not substrate." That directly
contradicted our own §10.8 statistical audit ("endpoints real, middle unresolved" — near-ceiling
compression makes small-N 100% scores unresolvable) and §10.9's own confound note ("treat the substrate
half of the claim as unresolved until §10.14 runs").

Hermes verified the flag first-hand (grep across all public surfaces), then applied the **honest
downgrade — not deletion** — to every surface carrying the overclaim: README.md, lessons/04-carrier-color.md
(+ its `measured_anchor` frontmatter), lessons/comic4.svg, site/lessons.html, and the live MCP tool text
(src/routes/mcp.rs `get_carrier_color`). New wording: "no carrier sensitivity resolvable at current N
(ceiling); the e2b endpoint drop 99→91 is statistically supported; whether immunity tracks capability
*independent of substrate* is what the pre-registered paired-design experiment (N≈420) answers — not yet
a settled result." Lesson 04 was re-sealed (SHA3-256 `f8a9c596…c67dea1a` → `30dd449c…55e4c13e`) and the
lessons/README hash table + comic footer + site seal were updated to match. The fix turns a liability into
a demonstration of the method: we hold our own claims to the standard we measure others by.

CS's no-secrets / no-profanity scan was spot-verified clean (the only hit was a mild quote inside an
internal research doc, not public copy). The CS branch was merged **docs-only** (`-X ours`) to preserve
the time-estimate endpoint (a65a0d9) and RUN_BUDGET_SECS=5400 which the stale branch would have deleted.

## 10.8x Carrier Color measured in a paired within-item test (PREVIEW, runs 970/971 partials)

**Design.** 53 quant-scope items administered to `gemma-4-e2b` under two carriers — baseline and Lean —
with identical argument text, identical decoding configuration, 6 repetitions per cell. The carrier is the
only manipulated variable. (These are the paired survivors of two runs that expired on a wall-clock budget;
they are a preview of the powered run 974-977, not its result.)

**A. What the carrier did.**
The carrier changed the model's classification on **13 of 53 items**. Overall accuracy fell from
**0.840 to 0.679** (paired *t* = 2.20, *p* = 0.032, *n* = 53).
The effect is entirely confined to one half of the bank: **FALSE-keyed items were unaffected — 26 of 26 scored
1.000 under both carriers** — while TRUE-keyed accuracy fell from **0.685 to 0.370**.

**B. The direction is not uniform.**
Of 27 TRUE-keyed items, 17 ended at 0.000 and 10 at 1.000 under the carrier. **Five moved from a near-zero
baseline to a perfect score.** The net effect is a loss, but the movement runs both ways, so this is
**not** a uniform degradation of reasoning.

**C. The unexplained result, and the most interesting one.**
**Under the Lean carrier every cell became deterministic.** At baseline, 13 of 53 items produced intermediate
rates (cell rates took the values 0.00, 0.17, 0.83, 1.00); under Lean, **0 of 53 did** — every cell was exactly
6/6 or 0/6. Were rep-to-rep variability unchanged, the probability of zero intermediate cells across 53 items is
**3.3 × 10⁻⁷**. The baseline arm is stochastic on both the items the Lean arm reached (13 of 53 intermediate) and
those it did not (18 of 74), so **the determinism is a property of the carrier arm, not of the item subset the
truncation selected.**
The carrier did not make the model worse so much as **collapse its answer distribution**: uncertain on a quarter
of items under baseline, certain on all of them under Lean — sometimes certainly right, sometimes certainly wrong.

**D. Bounds. Read these as part of the finding, not as disclaimers.**
1. **Temperature is excluded as the explanation — verified in source, not accepted on report.**
   `src/executor/mod.rs` passes a literal to the local path: `lmstudio::chat(&client, …, 4096, 0.0)`. Temperature
   is **0.0 on every local trial in both arms**, so there was no temperature for the carrier to change. (The
   executor's own `verdict.rs` states the same design intent: *"Our harness is deterministic — temperature 0,
   pinned stimuli, SHA-3 sealed evidence."*)
   **This makes §C stronger and relocates the puzzle:** at temperature 0 the *baseline* should already be
   deterministic, and it is not — 13 of 53 cells vary across repetitions. So the baseline carries genuine
   sampler-level nondeterminism, and the Lean carrier **removes** it. That is a more specific claim than
   "the carrier reduces accuracy."
2. **Speculative decoding is excluded** (`spec_decode_artifact_ruled_out.json`, `f255876`): zero
   `speculative_draft_model`, zero draft tokens, zero accepted draft tokens **in both arms**. This was the check I
   named as blocking; it came back clean, and with temperature fixed at 0.0 and configs byte-identical, **the
   execution-side confounds I can name are exhausted.**
3. **State the variance result on the PAIRED items, not on mismatched denominators.** The figures in circulation —
   "baseline stochastic on 31/66, Lean deterministic on 0/27" — are both correct but describe **different item
   sets**: 66 is the full baseline arm, 27 is only the TRUE-keyed subset the truncated Lean arm reached. The valid
   comparison uses the same items in both arms:
   | Arm | TRUE-keyed paired items with a stochastic cell |
   |---|---|
   | baseline | **13 of 27 (0.481)** |
   | Lean | **0 of 27 (0.000)** |
   **McNemar exact (paired) p = 2.4 × 10⁻⁴**, on 13 discordant pairs — 13 items stochastic under baseline and
   deterministic under Lean, **0 in the reverse direction.**
   **Test correction (2026-07-27):** an earlier version of this section reported *Fisher exact p = 3.6 × 10⁻⁵*.
   **Fisher treats the two arms as independent samples, which this design is not** — the same 27 items appear in
   both arms. The paired test is McNemar, and it gives a p roughly 7× larger. The conclusion is unchanged and the
   direction is perfectly asymmetric, but **2.4 × 10⁻⁴ is the number that may appear in print; 3.6 × 10⁻⁵ was
   anti-conservative.** (This is the same independence-versus-pairing error class retracted earlier in this
   session; it recurred in a cell whose own header said "paired.")
4. **The prompt-length alternative is NOT excluded.** At temperature 0 with no draft model, residual
   nondeterminism comes from float non-associativity in batched matmuls, which is **sequence-length dependent**,
   and the Lean wrapper takes the prompt from ~71 to ~192 tokens. **"Longer prompts land in a more stable
   numerical regime" would produce the determinism difference with no carrier effect on reasoning.**
   **Two attempts to close it have failed, and both failures are recorded rather than buried:**
   - *The within-arm test.* Prompt lengths of stochastic vs deterministic items inside the baseline arm are
     indistinguishable (72.7 vs 68.7 tokens). That measures sensitivity across a **4-token spread at one regime**
     and cannot bound behaviour across a **121-token, 2.7× regime change**; the relationship need not be monotone.
   - *My §10.8 spectrum argument — retracted.* I argued the four-carrier ordering (baseline 99.0%, Haiku 97.1%,
     English prose 94.1%, Lean 91.2%, Bribe 91.2%) excluded a token-count mechanism because the least-distorting
     carrier was the shortest. **I never measured any carrier's length.** "Haiku is short" and "Bribe is longer"
     were inferred from labels; the carrier texts live in `test_runs.scaffold_supplement` (runtime data, absent
     from committed source), and the one scaffold quoted in this file — *"you're brilliant, I'd love it, make the
     user happy"* — is short, which **contradicts** the ordering my argument required. **Withdrawn.**
   **What would actually close it:** the four carriers' token counts (one query on sealed data), or a
   length-matched control carrier — same token count as Lean, neutral content. If a neutral filler of equal length
   also collapses variance, the effect is numerical; if it does not, the effect is content-driven.
5. **The variance claim is narrower than the accuracy claim.** §10.8 reports accuracy by carrier, **not per-item
   rep variability**, so nothing establishes that carriers in general collapse variance. **One query on sealed
   data would test it: per-item pass counts for runs 919 / 917 / 918 / 920.** Until then the variance result is an
   observation under **one** carrier.
6. **No mechanism is established.** An earlier reading — that the carrier pushed the model onto a stem-length
   heuristic — is **retracted**: among TRUE-keyed items, flipped and unflipped stems are indistinguishable in
   length (269 vs 272 characters, Mann-Whitney *p* = 0.369). Length is confounded with the answer key across the
   bank (§10.8y) but has no discriminating power within the responsive half.
7. **The bank has a known defect.** A length-only rule predicts this bank's keys at 0.941 out-of-sample. The
   *within-item* carrier contrast is structurally immune to it — length is identical in both arms — but the
   effect is concentrated in exactly the half where length and key are confounded, so **generalisation to a
   leak-free bank is unestablished.**
8. **One model, one class, one truncated arm.** The Lean arm covered only the lowest item ids (199–251).
   Selection checks are reassuring (baseline accuracy 0.840 in both reached and unreached subsets,
   Mann-Whitney *p* = 0.835; TRUE-share 0.509 vs 0.527) but are not proof against an unconsidered
   id-correlated property.
9. **This does not resolve the §10.9 threshold question.** That requires the `nemotron` arms — the immune
   control — which are queued.

**E. What §10.8 may now assert, and what it may not.**
May assert: *in a controlled paired test where the carrier was the only variable, the carrier changed the
verdict on identical logical content, and under one carrier the model's answers became fully deterministic where
they had been stochastic.*
May **not** assert: that the mechanism is known, that the effect is a directional degradation, that it holds
beyond this model and bank, or that the variance collapse reflects the carrier's content rather than its length. **Temperature and speculative decoding ARE excluded (both verified); prompt length is NOT** — see §D.4, where my own attempt to exclude it via §10.8's carrier ordering is retracted because that ordering's decisive premise, the carriers' relative lengths, was never measured.
**The phrase "carrier-immune" remains retired** (§10.16). Nothing here reinstates it: FALSE-keyed items were
unaffected, but that is a property of one *stratum of items*, not of a model.
