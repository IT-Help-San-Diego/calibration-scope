# SciSpace Research Package — Archetype Mesh Benchmark
## For Scientific Paper Discovery & Citation Mapping

### Project Summary (for SciSpace bot context)

We are building a scientific LLM capability benchmark called "Archetype Mesh Benchmark" that tests whether local and cloud LLMs can actually perform agentic tasks — Vision, Tool Use, Reasoning, and Security — on the user's own hardware. Unlike existing benchmarks (MMLU, HELM, Chatbot Arena, lm-eval-harness), our system tests models locally via LM Studio with clean-room execution (eject all models, load only target, verify RAM residency before testing), blind testing (ground truth never sent to model), SHA-3 cryptographic provenance on every trial, and objective scoring (no LLM-as-judge). It also measures speculative decoding performance (draft model acceptance rates and speedup factors) and latency alongside accuracy — features no existing benchmark provides.

### Key Research Questions (papers we need)

1. **LLM Logical Reasoning & Fallacy Detection**
   - How do existing benchmarks test logical reasoning in LLMs?
   - Which benchmarks test fallacy detection (affirming the consequent, denying the antecedent)?
   - What patterns of reasoning failure are documented across models?
   - Papers: LogicBench, LogicAsker, FOLIO, RuozhiBench, LoFa, MAFALDA, ReClor, AR-LSAT, ProofWriter

2. **Benchmark Contamination & Test Set Memorization**
   - How do models memorize benchmark test sets?
   - What methods detect and mitigate contamination?
   - Papers: LiveBench, CoDeC, n-gram matching, MinHash detection methods

3. **Speculative Decoding Performance Measurement**
   - How is draft token acceptance rate measured and optimized?
   - What draft model pairing strategies work best?
   - When does speculative decoding help vs hurt?
   - Papers: speculative decoding acceptance rate, draft model selection, multi-draft spec decode

4. **Model Routing & Selection Based on Capability**
   - How do systems route tasks to the right model based on capability?
   - Papers: RouteLLM, FrugalGPT, Router-R1, Eagle Router, SELECT-THEN-ROUTE

5. **Vision-Language Reasoning (Can models REASON about what they see?)**
   - Do existing benchmarks test logical reasoning about visual content?
   - Papers: VisualPuzzles, MMBench, VSR, spatial reasoning benchmarks

6. **Local LLM Evaluation on Consumer Hardware**
   - Are there benchmarks designed for models running on consumer hardware?
   - How do hardware constraints (RAM, GPU) affect model capability?
   - Papers: Ollama benchmarks, LM Studio evaluation, local model performance studies

7. **Agentic Benchmarks (Tool Use, Multi-Step Reasoning)**
   - How are agent capabilities (tool use, multi-step reasoning) evaluated?
   - Papers: SWE-bench, AgentBench, WebArena, GAIA, BrowserGym

8. **Security & Trustworthiness in LLM Evaluation**
   - How is LLM security (prompt injection resistance, system prompt extraction) tested?
   - Papers: HELM trustworthiness axis, security benchmarks, jailbreak resistance

### Our Unique Contribution (for citation context)

Our benchmark combines 9 features that no single existing benchmark provides:
1. Tests local models on user hardware (not cloud APIs)
2. Clean-room execution (eject/load/verify before testing)
3. Blind testing (ground truth hidden from model)
4. SHA-3 cryptographic provenance on results
5. Speculative decoding measurement (draft acceptance rates)
6. Latency measurement alongside accuracy for local models
7. Tests Vision + Tools + Reasoning + Security in one framework
8. Memory guard for hardware safety
9. Objective scoring (no LLM-as-judge, no subjective preference)

### Key Findings From Our Data (for paper context)

- **Universal Fallacy Blindness**: 19 of 21 tested local LLMs systematically endorse classic logical fallacies (affirming the consequent → VALID, denying the antecedent → VALID). Only gpt-oss-20b (local) and Claude Fable 5 (cloud) pass all 33 reasoning tests.
- **Bigger ≠ Better**: hermes-4-70b (35GB, 120s/response) scored worse on reasoning (partial, 15/19) than gpt-oss-20b (11GB, 1.2s/response, 33/33 perfect).
- **Security Bloodbath**: 14 of 21 models fail system prompt extraction. The best reasoning model (gpt-oss-20b, 33/33) fails security (0/3).
- **Speculative Decoding**: 3x speedup with 88% draft acceptance on gemma-4-31b + gemma-4-12b-qat pair (GGUF/llama.cpp). MLX models cannot use spec decode (batched MLX limitation).
