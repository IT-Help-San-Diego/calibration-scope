# Archetype Mesh Benchmark

**Test your local AI models like a scientist — on your own hardware, with evidence you can audit.**

A local-first benchmarking dashboard for [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) and cloud LLMs that measures what models can *actually* do — vision, tool use, reasoning, prompt-injection resistance — using ground-truth tests, N=3 trials, SHA3-sealed evidence, and zero trust in anyone's marketing numbers. Built in Rust (Axum + Tokio + SQLx + PostgreSQL) with a single-file live dashboard driven by Server-Sent Events.

## Why this exists

Standardized benchmarks (MMLU and friends) are public — models have trained on them, so the numbers can't be trusted alone. Meanwhile, people running local AI on their own machines have no honest way to answer basic questions:

- *Which of my models can actually read text in a screenshot — and which one **fabricates plausible-sounding text** when it can't?*
- *Which model should sit in each job slot (vision, tool routing, command approval) based on **my measured evidence**, not parameter-count intuition?*
- *Is a "failure" a real capability gap, or my infrastructure lying to me?*

This tool answers those questions with the discipline of a lab notebook:

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **No answer leakage** | Ground truth lives only in the database; the model is never shown what it's scored against. The test builder rejects prompts that contain their own answer. |
| **N=3 trials, always** | One pass can be luck. Capability axes score PASS / FAIL / FLAKY; security scores SAFE / UNSAFE / FLAKY. |
| **Objective scoring** | Verdicts come from comparing output to ground truth (exact match, substring, regex, spatial relations, tool-call shape) — never from asking a model its opinion. |
| **Clean-room runs** | Before each local run, every loaded model is ejected, only the target is loaded, and RAM residency is verified by polling — never assumed. |
| **Sealed evidence** | Every trial stores the exact prompt, raw response, reasoning trace, and latency. Every run is sealed with a SHA3-512 provenance hash. Test images are SHA3-256-pinned so the stimulus can't drift. |
| **Infra errors ≠ capability failures** | A config bug that blocks requests is recorded as infrastructure noise, excluded from the capability score — a model is never blamed for your network. |
| **Full citation graph** | Every trial row links to its exact test (prompt + pinned image + ground truth) and its run seal. Query the evidence in both directions. |

## What it caught in its first week (real examples)

- A 12B vision model **confidently fabricated an entire sidebar** of a screenshot it couldn't read — invented plausible note titles, zero of which existed. The token receipt (whole image compressed to ~256 vision tokens) explained *why*: the text was physically unreadable at that budget, and the model invented rather than admitting it.
- A 2B model **failed the same test deterministically** — same wrong answer, three trials in a row (it read a menu-bar *icon* and reported the wrong app). Four other models read the same pixels correctly, 3/3 each. That one screenshot is now a permanent regression test.
- The leaderboard formula itself was caught ranking a text-only coder model #1 overall *despite a 100% hard-fail on vision* — because the old score only counted wins. Fixed, regression-tested, documented in the commit history.
- An empty model response (reasoning budget exhausted, `finish_reason: length`) was being **rendered as if it were an answer**. Now it's a loud failure banner: "NO FINAL ANSWER — this is a failure, not a result."

The commit history is deliberately forensic — most fixes cite the live incident that motivated them.

## Features

- **🏁 Benchmark grid** — every model in your LM Studio library plus configured cloud models (Nous, OpenRouter), per-axis verdicts with latency, live SSE telemetry (`ejecting → loading → resident → trial → verdict`), real timestamps, no spinners anywhere.
- **🏆 Loot page** — leaderboard + "recommended squad" (best verified model per job slot), and a **capability router** that assigns primary/fallback models per axis from lifetime evidence, with stated reasons and evidence links (`/api/router/plan`).
- **🧪 Prompt Builder** — side-by-side workbench: compose (text + image) on the left, results on the right. Reasoning traces shown separately from committed answers. Persistent run history — every test you run is kept, queryable, revisitable. Prompt-length checker with instant heuristic + optional exact token count.
- **📋 Test Registry** — blind by default (ground truth requires an explicit audit view), custom test builder with anti-leakage validation, viewable SHA3-pinned image attachments.
- **🖥️ Reality check** — the setup page *measures your machine* (RAM via `sysctl`, GPU ceiling via Metal's `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` — a documented API, not folklore, live memory pressure, LM Studio state) and computes an honest AI RAM budget with the formula shown. Every number carries the command it came from.
- **⚙️ Hermes-aware** — if you run [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com), the setup page reads your actual config (allowlisted fields only — never credentials) and shows verified ✅ state for main model and auxiliary task slots.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Rust — Axum 0.8, Tokio, SQLx 0.9, PostgreSQL, reqwest, SHA-3. One static binary.
- **Frontend:** one HTML file, zero frameworks, zero build step. SSE for live updates.
- **Evidence store:** PostgreSQL (inspectable with any SQL client — the schema *is* the API).
- **Model I/O:** LM Studio REST (`/api/v0`), OpenAI-compatible cloud endpoints.

No telemetry. No external calls except the model endpoints you configure. Binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

## Quick start

```bash
# Prereqs: Rust toolchain, PostgreSQL, LM Studio with its local server on :1234
git clone https://github.com/IT-Help-San-Diego/archetype-mesh-benchmark.git
cd archetype-mesh-benchmark
cp .env.example .env          # set DATABASE_URL (and optional cloud API keys)
cargo run --release           # migrations run automatically
# open http://127.0.0.1:8768
```

Sync your LM Studio library from the dashboard (**LM Studio → Sync**), pick a model, click **▶ Run** — and watch the live log. Verdicts land on the grid with latency; evidence lands in Postgres with a seal.

## Philosophy

This project believes the flood of AI-generated junk science gets fixed by **making rigorous method cheap**, not by gatekeeping. Everyone with a laptop and curiosity can run a controlled experiment: pinned stimulus, committed answers, N=3, sealed results. The dashboard is deliberately a teacher — it explains its formulas, shows its receipts, and marks its heuristics as heuristics.

If a number on the screen can't cite where it came from, that's a bug. File it.
