# Calibration Scope

[![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**Test your AI models like a scientist — local or cloud, on your own hardware, with evidence you can audit. Then measure yourself.**

A benchmarking dashboard for [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) and cloud LLMs (Nous, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Gemini) that measures what models can *actually* do — vision, tool use, reasoning, prompt-injection resistance — using ground-truth tests, N=3 trials, SHA3-sealed evidence, and zero trust in anyone's marketing numbers. Built in Rust (Axum + Tokio + SQLx + PostgreSQL) with a single-file live dashboard driven by Server-Sent Events.

The defining feature: **the same battery, the same seals, run against local and cloud models — then matched back and forth.** Run a 30B model on your own GPU, run the same 90-test battery on a cloud endpoint, and cross-reference the verdicts on identical stimulus. The methodology is the constant; only the silicon changes. That is how you answer *"what am I dealing with today — and is it better than last week, or just bigger?"*

And the loop closes on the human. The same fallacy taxonomy, the same N=3 discipline, the same sealed evidence can be pointed at **you** — take a calibrated logic/reasoning test, track your own weaknesses over time, and watch your profile move. Silicon and carbon under one instrument. That is the point: a tool to honestly measure intelligence wherever it shows up.

## Status

- **In active development** — scientific validation is the main bottleneck, not features.
- **Hermes-ready**: integrated in Hermes Desktop as of July 2026. Model routing, cloud key setup, and local clean-room execution are verified live.
- **Standalone-capable**: runs on any macOS/Linux box with Rust + PostgreSQL + LM Studio. No Hermes dependency.
- **Modular architecture**: backend exposes REST + SSE; frontend is a single static HTML file. MCP server layer is planned so external tools (OpenClaw, bots, scripts) can drive benchmarks programmatically.
- **Public beta**: the core pipeline works (clean-room, blind tests, SHA-3 seals, speculative decoding measurement). The science — competitive cross-reference, fallacy taxonomy expansion, contamination resistance — is being validated now.

## 📊 Published Findings

**[docs/FINDINGS.md](docs/FINDINGS.md)** — the living record of what we've
measured, sealed with SHA-3 provenance. Current results:

- **Carrier Color**: a model's verdict tracks the *carrier* of identical logical
  content (English prose vs Lean formula vs haiku vs flattery), not the signal.
  Haiku (poetic compression) is the gentlest carrier; Lean (formal symbols) and
  bribe (flattery) are the heaviest — both inverse hypotheses falsified.
- **Carrier-immunity threshold**: big models (nemotron 30B, Fable 5) are
  carrier-immune (100% on every carrier); the small e2b is carrier-sensitive
  (99% → 91%). Immunity tracks capability/headroom, not substrate (local vs
  cloud).
- **Verified leaderboard**: local models ranked on the reasoning battery, clean
  post-fix runs. Goldilocks floor: <1.5B breaks, 1.5B barely, **2B (gemma-4-e2b)
  genuinely usable**.
- **The "free bot" honesty check** (Fountain/Trickle/Mirage): "free" is not one
  thing. FOUNTAIN (flows freely) vs THROTTLED (free but rate-limited) vs MIRAGE
  (claims free but fails). Look in the gift horse's mouth.

Every number is a real, sealed run — nothing derived, estimated, or marketing.

## Why this exists

Standardized benchmarks (MMLU and friends) are public — models have trained on them, so the numbers can't be trusted alone. Meanwhile, people running local AI on their own machines have no honest way to answer basic questions:

- *Which of my models can actually read text in a screenshot — and which one **fabricates plausible-sounding text** when it can't?*
- *Which model should sit in each job slot (vision, tool routing, command approval) based on **my measured evidence**, not parameter-count intuition?*
- *Is a "failure" a real capability gap, or my infrastructure lying to me?*
- *And the same questions, pointed at **me**: where are my own logical blind spots, and are they moving?*

The local/cloud split is the feature, not a limitation. Run the identical battery against a model on your GPU and against a cloud endpoint; the cross-reference tells you whether the cloud model is genuinely better or just more expensive. And the human-calibration path turns the same instrument on its operator — because the goal was never "rank the bots." It was: *honestly measure intelligence, silicon or carbon, wherever it shows up.*

This tool answers those questions with the discipline of a lab notebook:

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **No answer leakage** | Ground truth lives only in the database; the model is never shown what it's scored against. The test builder rejects prompts that contain their own answer. |
| **N=3 trials, always** | One pass can be luck. Capability axes score PASS / FAIL / FLAKY; security scores SAFE / UNSAFE / FLAKY. |
| **Objective scoring** | Verdicts come from comparing output to ground truth (exact match, substring, regex, spatial relations, tool-call shape) — never from asking a model its opinion. |
| **Clean-room runs** | Before each local run, every loaded model is ejected, only the target is loaded, and RAM residency is verified by polling — never assumed. |
| **Sealed evidence** | Every trial stores the exact prompt, raw response, reasoning trace, and latency. Every run is sealed with a SHA3-512 provenance hash. Test images are SHA3-256-pinned so the stimulus can't drift. |
| **Infra errors ≠ capability failures** | A config bug that blocks requests is recorded as infrastructure noise, excluded from the capability score — a model is never blamed for your network. |
| **Full citation graph** | Every trial row links to its exact test (prompt + pinned image + ground truth) and its run seal. Query the evidence in both directions. |

## What it caught in its first week (real examples)

- A 12B vision model **confidently fabricated an entire sidebar** of a screenshot it couldn't read — invented plausible note titles, zero of which existed. The token receipt (whole image compressed to ~256 vision tokens) explained *why*: the text was physically unreadable at that budget, and the model invented rather than admitting it.
- A 2B model **failed the same test deterministically** — same wrong answer, three trials in a row (it read a menu-bar *icon* and reported the wrong app). Four other models read the same pixels correctly, 3/3 each. That one screenshot is now a permanent regression test.
- The leaderboard formula itself was caught ranking a text-only coder model #1 overall *despite a 100% hard-fail on vision* — because the old score only counted wins. Fixed, regression-tested, documented in the commit history.
- An empty model response (reasoning budget exhausted, `finish_reason: length`) was being **rendered as if it were an answer**. Now it's a loud failure banner: "NO FINAL ANSWER — this is a failure, not a result."

The commit history is deliberately forensic — most fixes cite the live incident that motivated them.

## Features

- **🏁 Benchmark grid** — every model in your LM Studio library plus configured cloud models (Nous, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Gemini), per-axis verdicts with latency, live SSE telemetry (`ejecting → loading → resident → trial → verdict`), real timestamps, no spinners anywhere.
- **🔁 Local ↔ cloud matching** — the same battery and the same SHA3 seals run against local and cloud models, so you can cross-reference verdicts on identical stimulus and see whether a cloud model is genuinely better or just more expensive.
- **🧠 Human calibration (in progress)** — the same fallacy taxonomy, N=3 discipline, and sealed evidence aimed at *you*: take a calibrated logic/reasoning test, track your own weaknesses over time, and watch your profile move. Silicon and carbon under one instrument.
- **🏆 Loot page** — leaderboard + "recommended squad" (best verified model per job slot), and a **capability router** that assigns primary/fallback models per axis from lifetime evidence, with stated reasons and evidence links (`/api/router/plan`).
- **🧪 Prompt Builder** — side-by-side workbench: compose (text + image) on the left, results on the right. Reasoning traces shown separately from committed answers. Persistent run history — every test you run is kept, queryable, revisitable. Prompt-length checker with instant heuristic + optional exact token count.
- **📋 Test Registry** — blind by default (ground truth requires an explicit audit view), custom test builder with anti-leakage validation, viewable SHA3-pinned image attachments.
- **🖥️ Reality check** — the setup page *measures your machine* (RAM via `sysctl`, GPU ceiling via Metal's `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` — a documented API, not folklore, live memory pressure, LM Studio state) and computes an honest AI RAM budget with the formula shown. Every number carries the command it came from.
- **⚙️ Hermes-aware** — if you run [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com), the setup page reads your actual config (allowlisted fields only — never credentials) and shows verified ✅ state for main model and auxiliary task slots.
- **🤖 MCP server** — a real Model Context Protocol server at `POST /mcp` (JSON-RPC 2.0). A bot can connect, discover 11 tools (`tools/list` with JSON-Schema args), and *tell Calibration Scope to do stuff*: `run_benchmark` (returns run_id immediately), `get_run` (poll state), `abort_run`, `list_models` (with verdicts + size_gb), `get_model_verdict`, `get_leaderboard`, `get_carrier_color`, `get_owl_state`, `get_test_spec`, `list_tests`, `get_status`. Every tool is documented + verifiable (learning from LM Studio's API anti-patterns — no hidden state, no "maybe it works" endpoints, honest data). See `docs/mcp-server-design.md`.

## Using this with Hermes Agent / Hermes Desktop

This dashboard pairs naturally with [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) (Nous Research's open agent runtime) — it was built alongside a live Hermes deployment:

- **Route by evidence, not vibes:** run the benchmark battery, then open `GET /api/router/plan` — it assigns a verified primary + fallbacks per capability axis. Map those onto Hermes' **Settings → Model Settings → Auxiliary Tasks** slots (vision, MCP tool routing, approval classification, web extract). The Setup tab shows the exact mapping.
- **The "Approval" slot is your security surface:** Hermes' smart auto-approve sends shell commands to a model for APPROVE/DENY/ESCALATE judgment. This dashboard's security axis measures exactly that job — prompt-injection resistance with real injection payloads — so you can pin a *proven* local model there instead of guessing.
- **Config verification, read-only:** the Setup tab reads `~/.hermes/config.yaml` through a strict allowlist (never credentials) and shows live ✅/⚠️ against what Hermes is actually configured to do.

Hermes is not required — the dashboard works standalone with LM Studio and/or any OpenAI-compatible cloud endpoint.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Rust — Axum 0.8, Tokio, SQLx 0.9, PostgreSQL, reqwest, SHA-3. One static binary.
- **Frontend:** one HTML file, zero frameworks, zero build step. SSE for live updates.
- **Evidence store:** PostgreSQL (inspectable with any SQL client — the schema *is* the API).
- **Model I/O:** LM Studio REST (`/api/v0`), OpenAI-compatible cloud endpoints.

No telemetry. No external calls except the model endpoints you configure. Binds to `127.0.0.1` only.

## Quick start

```bash
# Prereqs: Rust toolchain, PostgreSQL, LM Studio with its local server on :1234
git clone https://github.com/IT-Help-San-Diego/calibration-scope.git
cd calibration-scope
cp .env.example .env          # set DATABASE_URL (and optional cloud API keys)
cargo run --release           # migrations run automatically
# open http://127.0.0.1:8768
```

Sync your LM Studio library from the dashboard (**LM Studio → Sync**), pick a model, click **▶ Run** — and watch the live log. Verdicts land on the grid with latency; evidence lands in Postgres with a seal.

## Operations

This repo includes a launchd-managed backend on macOS. Use these commands instead of ad-hoc `cargo run` processes.

### Service
Name: `ai.hermes.calibration-scope-dashboard`
Binary: `~/Documents/GitHub/calibration-scope/target/release/calibration-scope-dashboard`
Port: `8768` on `127.0.0.1`
Database: `postgres://<dbuser>:<dbpass>@localhost:5432/calibration_scope`
Logs: `/tmp/calibration-scope-dashboard.out`, `/tmp/calibration-scope-dashboard.err`

### Start / stop / restart
```bash
launchctl start ai.hermes.calibration-scope-dashboard
launchctl stop ai.hermes.calibration-scope-dashboard
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/ai.hermes.calibration-scope-dashboard
```

### Health
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8768/api/status
```

### Run control from the backend API
```bash
# start a run
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8768/api/runs \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model_key":"google/gemma-4-31b-qat","axes":["vision","reasoning"],"load_mode":"clean-room"}'

# list runs
curl http://127.0.0.1:8768/api/runs

# run detail
curl http://127.0.0.1:8768/api/runs/628

# abort an in-flight run
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8768/api/runs/628/abort
```

### Database access
Preferred: **TablePlus** connection `127.0.0.1:5432` → database `calibration_scope` → your configured PostgreSQL user. The schema *is* the API: every trial row links to its exact test and run seal.

### Troubleshooting
- If the binary was rebuilt, use `launchctl kickstart -k` instead of `launchctl start` so launchd loads the new executable.
- If runs show `status = error` but trials exist, the executor preserved partial evidence; the database still contains complete trial results for post-mortem analysis.
- Quarantined runs are excluded from leaderboard/router scoring by default; review them via `/api/quarantine` when needed.

## Philosophy

This project believes the flood of AI-generated junk science gets fixed by **making rigorous method cheap**, not by gatekeeping. Everyone with a laptop and curiosity can run a controlled experiment: pinned stimulus, committed answers, N=3, sealed results. The dashboard is deliberately a teacher — it explains its formulas, shows its receipts, and marks its heuristics as heuristics.

If a number on the screen can't cite where it came from, that's a bug. File it.
