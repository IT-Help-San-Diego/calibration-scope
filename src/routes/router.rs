//! GET /api/router/plan — the capability router.
//!
//! Turns accumulated benchmark evidence into an explicit, auditable routing
//! plan: for each capability axis, which model should a job be dispatched to,
//! which models are acceptable fallbacks, and which are excluded — with a
//! stated reason and a sealed evidence pointer for every single placement.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS NOT JUST /api/loot's SQUAD
//! The loot squad answers "fastest model to EVER fully pass" — a trophy-case
//! question, correct for a leaderboard. A router must answer a stricter
//! question: "which model do I trust with real work?" One lucky 3/3 run is a
//! win; it is not a routing basis. This endpoint therefore classifies on the
//! AGGREGATE record (every trial ever run on the axis, infra errors already
//! excluded upstream by the executor) and demands a minimum evidence count
//! before promoting anything to primary.
//!
//! POLICY (deterministic, echoed in the response so every plan is
//! self-describing — a consumer can always tell WHICH policy produced it):
//!   PRIMARY   — 100% lifetime pass rate (integer compare, not float) AND
//!               total_trials >= min_trials (default 3). Among eligible,
//!               fastest best_ms wins; more trials breaks ties.
//!   FALLBACK  — either (a) 100% pass rate but not enough trials yet
//!               ("promising, under-evidenced"), or (b) pass rate >=
//!               fallback_threshold (default 0.8) but imperfect ("flaky").
//!               Perfect-but-slower primaries also land here, ranked first —
//!               they are genuinely the best fallbacks.
//!   EXCLUDED  — pass rate below the fallback threshold, or zero passes.
//!               Every exclusion carries a human-readable reason; silence is
//!               how the coder-7B leaderboard bug happened (2026-07-08) and
//!               we do not repeat it here.
//!   UNTESTED models simply do not appear — absence of evidence is absence
//!               from the plan, never a verdict.
//!
//! Read-only: no writes, no new tables. Pure decision function over
//! test_runs + models, the same substrate the leaderboard uses.
