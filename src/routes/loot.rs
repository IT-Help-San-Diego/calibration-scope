//! GET /api/loot — the trophy case + squad-building leaderboard.
//!
//! Answers the two questions the demographic actually asks:
//!   1. "What's my best bot for X?" — per-axis champion: among models that
//!      ever fully PASSED/SAFE'd this axis, the fastest one, with the run
//!      that proves it (timestamp + SHA3 seal).
//!   2. "Which bots should I load into which slots?" — a recommended squad:
//!      one model per axis, chosen the same way, framed explicitly as a
//!      loadout (mirrors Hermes' main-model / auxiliary-task split).
//!
//! Aggregates across ALL completed runs per (model, axis), not just the
//! latest — a model's loot is its best-ever proof, same as any leaderboard.
//!
//! overall_score is NOT just "sum of wins + speed" (that was the bug found
//! live 2026-07-08: a text-only coding model with a 100% HARD FAIL on the
//! vision axis — every trial an HTTP 400, not just a wrong answer — topped
//! the leaderboard, because the old formula never looked at what a model
//! failed, only what it won). See the compute block in loot_handler for the
//! fix: hard fails on core axes now actively penalize the score, and
//! breadth of testing (core_axes_tested) is rewarded separately from wins,
//! so "best, most rounded, capable" actually means what it says.

    //      100%-fail axis produced ZERO speed bonus (correctly) but also
    //      ZERO penalty, so the score simply ignored it existed. Now it
    //      actively costs the model rank, proportional to how many core
    //      capabilities it's missing, not just silent on them.
    //   2. WELL-ROUNDED BONUS: a flat bonus per core axis the model has
    //      ANY evidence for, separate from whether it won — rewards
    //      breadth of testing/capability over a model that's only ever
    //      been run on its one strong axis and never tried anything else.
