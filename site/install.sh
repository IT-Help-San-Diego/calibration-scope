#   curl -fsSL https://calibrationscope.com/install.sh | sh
#
# What this does, in order (macOS):
#   1. If the instrument already answers on 127.0.0.1:8768 — opens it, done.
#      If something ELSE holds that port, or another calibration-scope service
#      exists, it stops and tells you — it never installs a competitor.
#   2. brew install it-help-san-diego/tap/calibration-scope
#      (self-contained binary; postgresql@17 comes along as a dependency)
#   3. Ensures a PostgreSQL server is reachable on 127.0.0.1:5432 — uses yours
#      if one is listening, otherwise starts the brew one as a boot-persistent
#      service.
#   4. Creates the calibration_scope database and VERIFIES the connection
#      before writing the dashboard service.
#   5. Installs a launchd service (com.calibrationscope.dashboard), then opens
#      http://127.0.0.1:8768.
#
# Design rules this script obeys:
#   - NEVER interactive: no prompts, no editors, no pagers, and psql/createdb
#     run with -w (never ask for a password). It either finishes or exits
#     loudly with exactly what to do next. (A one-liner is only as good as it
#     can close on its own self.)
#   - Everything is wrapped in main() and invoked on the LAST line, so a
#     truncated download parses to nothing instead of executing half a script.
#   - Safe to re-run: a re-run repairs a broken install. (Upgrades are brew's
#     job: brew upgrade it-help-san-diego/tap/calibration-scope)
#   - No telemetry, nothing phones home. This script talks to brew, your
#     local Postgres, and 127.0.0.1 — that's all.
#
# Knobs (env vars, all optional):
#   CALIBRATION_SCOPE_DATABASE_URL  use this connection string instead of the
#                                   auto-provisioned postgres://<you>@127.0.0.1
